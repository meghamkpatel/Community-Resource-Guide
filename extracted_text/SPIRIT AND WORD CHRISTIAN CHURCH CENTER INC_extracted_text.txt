WHAT IS HELPS MINISTRY?
H.E.L.P.S. Ministry means “Having Enough Loving People Serving” in the church attending to, aiding, supporting and serving one another in the ministry of the church with Christian affection. What is the Helps Ministry Office (HMO)?

• Everyone who comes through the doors of LWCC is to be treated in a spirit of excellence as though it was their first visit.
• Set a warm and inviting atmosphere, be the first to smile and say ‘hello’.
• Every volunteer (referred to here as Helps Minister) is to serve in love and excellence at all times.
