Welcome to Parkwood Association
Welcome to PPM Engage: the official communication tool of Professional Properties Management (PPM) and Parkwood Association.
Parkwood is a planned community located in South Durham, North Carolina. As one of the very first homeowner associations in the state, Parkwood is home to a diverse group of nearly 3,000 people. Originally designed as the primary neighborhood for employees of the Research Triangle Park, Parkwood’s unique history is unmatched in North Carolina.
Parkwood is the proud home of more than 100 acres of shared parkland, 4 playgrounds, a ballfield and swim club, an elementary school, various houses of worship, an excellent Mediterranean restaurant and grocery, and more.
Interested in calling Parkwood your home? Be sure to read our community bylaws, and learn about the various committees who work hard to keep Parkwood the beautiful and fun neighborhood it is known to be.
