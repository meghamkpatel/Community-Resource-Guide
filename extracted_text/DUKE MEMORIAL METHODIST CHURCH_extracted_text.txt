Formation
Throughout the week we gather to fellowship and grow together.
Duke Memorial offers many ways to engage in the life of our congregation throughout the week. These groups meet in homes, breweries, and church. We gather together people around a central idea, question, or activity so that we can be formed in faith together.

Our Story
When Duke Memorial was birthed in 1886, one of its founders, Mr. Washington Duke, believed this new church in the West End of downtown Durham was to be a church for the masses. Today our mission is much the same. Our congregation desires to share Christ from the heart of Durham through our hospitality and welcome, through our worship of God, through our faith in and faithfulness to Jesus Christ, and through our work of compassion, justice, and peace in Durham and beyond​.
