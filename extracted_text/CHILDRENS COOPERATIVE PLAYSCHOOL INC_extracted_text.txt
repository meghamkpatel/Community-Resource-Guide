Learn More
Location
Our school is conveniently located at the intersection of Pope Road and Ephesus Church Road in Chapel Hill just off 15-501.
What is a Co-op?
As a cooperative, all of our families participate in integral ways to help keep our non-profit school running.
Play-based learning
Our days are structured around play, giving the children the opportunity to lead and explore as an avenue to learning.
Grow creative confidence
Each week, we begin with a weekly theme and we explore the theme together in each classroom through the mediums of art, reading and play.  Each day your child will use their imagination  to engage in creative learning and connection with their peers.
Join our community
As a small school and as a co-op, we encourage families to participate in their children’s early education with us! Stay after school and play with other children, join us for a potluck or a yard clean-up day. Our school is based on community involvement and connection, and we hope you’ll join us!
