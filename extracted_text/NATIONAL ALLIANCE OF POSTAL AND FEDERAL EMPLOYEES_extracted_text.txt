Welcome To NAPFE
The National Alliance of Postal and Federal Employees welcomes you to its Website.
The National Alliance of Postal and Federal Employees
is an independent labor Union that is composed of three tiers: the National – headquartered in Washington, District of Columbia; Nine Districts – with a division of the fifty states, the U. S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico; and various Locals – located within the fifty states, U. S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico.
This is your Union and your participation will contribute to the greatness of the National Alliance.
It is true that being Federal employees, strikes and lockouts are beyond the realm of our personal experiences. It is also true that we have much in common with people in non-federal employees union's because we are a significant part of American Labor. This is why it is important to understand the philosophy and the history of the movement not only of the Alliance but of trade unionism in general.
The steward is your union representative right on the job. He or she is elected directly by the members in your job unit, or is appointed as provided by Local by-laws. Stewards are your contact point for information about the union and its activities. They handle grievances as they arise, accepting them from the members and seeking to adjust them with first-line supervision. They refer unsettled grievances to the proper Local Officer, so that they may be processed according to the grievance procedure.
If your seniority rights have been ignored, if you have been unjustly discharged, if you have improperly been denied a promotion to a better job, or if you have any other grievance, see your Alliance steward without delay.
In the spirit of genuine helpfulness, the N.A.P.F.E. offers these friendly words of advice. Learn as much as possible as quickly as possible about your duties as an employee. Inquire whenever necessary of the proper authority about those matters concerning your employment with which you are unfamiliar.
Pay particular attention to all instructions. Obey all orders promptly. Avoid any semblance of an altercation or dispute with your fellow or supervisory employees. Now, if you do have difficulty, which means friction, remember there is a right way and a wrong way to deal with it. If you protest verbally on the spot, do it with courtesy and firmness. If in doubt as to either the method or result, consult the Labor Relations Officer of your local of the National Alliance of Postal and federal Employees.
Punctuality is a must. When you are scheduled to work, you are most definitely expected to show up. Only a good reason that will bear inspection can relieve you of these obligations. If you can't show up, phone in early, so other arrangements can be made. If you like the service and are proud of it, this will be reflected in your good conduct both on the job and in the street.
In other words be efficient, well informed, courteous and punctual.
In this way, your value as a federal employee will be enhanced.
And, last but not least, be an active member in the Alliance. Share your ideas about the advantages of belonging to your Union with new employees and other people you meet at work. The National Alliance needs you and your ideas.

REMEMBER
: the equality and dignity the National Alliance seeks and fights for is the right for any American citizen to hold any job and position for which he or she is qualified or can be trained to handle; the right to that training; the right to promotion to higher skilled work; and the end to unsanitary, unsafe and low paying work that has been traditionally reserved for black men and women.
