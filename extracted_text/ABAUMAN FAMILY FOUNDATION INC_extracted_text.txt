Advancing Advocacy
All Americans deserve to have a say in the policies that affect them; we support them in their struggle to amplify their voice and be heard by policymakers.
Amplifying Impact
We believe that civic engagement and advocacy can build power, making our democracy stronger and more vibrant.
Promoting Open and Transparent Government
We believe that democracy works best when the government is accountable to the people it serves. To ensure this accountability, the government must be open and honest about its work.
Strengthening Democracy
We believe in the principles of the constitution that guarantee that all eligible voters should be able to participate in free and fair elections.
