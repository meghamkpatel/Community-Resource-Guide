Consortium
Transforming Perioperative Care
A global collaboration to advance patient-centered, perioperative care through science, education and policy.
Our mission
Improve the health of the population by:
Inspiring a global community of innovators in perioperative care to create sustainable health care solutions
Advancing the science of perioperative medicine through world-class research
Fostering learning to develop perioperative leaders and educators
Leading transformative discussions to shape future perioperative care practices and health care policy
About Morpheus Consortium
Named after the ancient Greek god of dreams, the Morpheus Consortium embodies a shared aspiration to deliver innovative perioperative care to meet the evolving needs of patients undergoing major surgery. It’s also the branding of three universities, Duke University, University College London and University of Southampton, with one shared goal – to be the leaders in perioperative medicine and enhanced recovery after surgery, ultimately improving the patients’ journey from the moment their surgery is contemplated to full recovery.

Boards
National Board of Perioperative Medicine
Perioperative medicine is an evolving field of medicine that addresses the vulnerabilities of increasing age and complexity of patients and the increase in the number of surgical procedures being performed in United States. There is a critical need to standardize the evidence-based care of surgical patients at risk to ensure optimal outcomes.
The National Board of Perioperative Medicine comprises a group of medical professionals who are considered experts in their respective areas of Perioperative Medicine. The aim of the board is to formulate a perioperative medicine syllabus for use in the training of physicians in perioperative medicine in the United States.

We are a very innovative department and we at Duke want to be leading the way as we move into this new era of health care.
Dr. Timothy Miller
In the continuum of a life cycle of an entity, you begin by surviving, then you evolve to growth, and if you’re fortunate enough you enter that sphere of ‘lead.’ With this collaboration, we’re looking at ‘lead’ in the rearview mirror and shaping the future.
Dr. Solomon Aronson
Our health systems have crossover, but are significantly different. There is a massive opportunity to learn from each other and take the best from both sides of the Atlantic.
Professor Mike Grocott

Solomon Aronson, MD, MBA, FASA, FACC, FCCP, FAHA, FASE, is a tenured professor at Duke University and executive vice chairman within Duke Anesthesiology. Dr. Aronson is recognized as an expert on topics concerning perioperative echocardiography, perioperative blood pressure risk, perioperative medicine and population health, health care strategy and health economics; he has written more than 300 manuscripts, book chapters and abstracts, as well as six textbooks, lectured nationally and internationally, and has been repeatedly elected by his peers to be listed in
Best Doctors in America
.
Dr. Aronson earned his BS in molecular biology with distinction at the University of Wisconsin and his MD with honors in research at the Medical College of Wisconsin. After completing an anesthesiology residency at the University of Texas Medical Galveston, he completed a fellowship in cardiac and vascular anesthesia at the Texas Heart Institute in Houston. He was then recruited to the University of Chicago where he ascended to the rank of full professor and served as chief of the Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia Division. In 2011, Dr. Aronson received his MBA with a concentration in health sector management at Duke University Fuqua School of Business. In 2013, he was elected to the Science Accelerator Committee and the Leadership Committee for Cardiopulmonary, Critical Care, Perioperative & Resuscitation Council of the American Heart Association. In 2017, he was honored with an adjunct professor appointment from University College London. Among other roles, Dr. Aronson serves on the board of directors and as the director of business development for the Physicians Diagnostic Clinic (PDC), a physician practice group at Duke. In 2018, he was re-elected as vice chair on the PDC Board of Managers. He continues to serve on the FDA as a consultant SGE after having served as a member of the Anesthesia and Life Support Advisory Committee and Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee.
Joseph Mathew, MD, MHSc, MBA, FASE, is the Jerry Reves Professor of Anesthesiology and chairman of Duke Anesthesiology at Duke University School of Medicine (appointed March of 2015). Dr. Mathew is an active physician-scientist funded by the National Institutes of Health for his research on perioperative neurocognition and functional brain connectivity, particularly in the setting of cardiac surgery.
He received his medical degree from Southwestern Medical School in Dallas, Texas, and completed his residency in anesthesiology and a fellowship in cardiovascular anesthesiology at Yale University School of Medicine. He spent eight years at Yale where he served as associate professor of anesthesiology. In 1998, Dr. Mathew joined the faculty at Duke Anesthesiology and has since served as director of the Perioperative Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE), director of the Neurological Outcome Research Group, chief of the Cardiothoracic Anesthesia Division, and executive vice chair of performance and operations for the department. He has published extensively on postoperative atrial fibrillation and is the editor of the leading textbook on perioperative TEE. He is also a member of the Foundation for Anesthesia Education and Research’s Academy of Research Mentors.
John Borrelli, MBA, began serving as chief administrator within Duke Anesthesiology in October of 2011. He manages the departmental budget and runs a business office responsible for HR and operations, finance and accounting, revenue cycle management, grants administration, and IT services, specializing in perioperative DataMart, management systems and application development. Borrelli also serves as an adjunct professor at Roberts Wesleyan College in Rochester, New York.
Borrelli has worked in the health care field since 1991, alternating between roles in university, hospital and physician settings. For more than 20 years, he has developed finance and management expertise, with strong problem-solving and team-working skills. Prior to Duke, Borrelli was at University of Rochester Medical Center’s Eastman Institute for Oral Health, where he last served as associate vice president.
