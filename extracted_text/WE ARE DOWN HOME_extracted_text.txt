Rural Organizing in North Carolina
Down Home North Carolina is building power with poor and working-class people in North Carolina’s small towns and rural communities.
ALL ARE WELCOME AT DOWN HOME.
Together, we are taking action to increase democracy, grow the good in our communities, and pass a healthy and just home down to our grandbabies.

We are poor and working class and we know that building multiracial power is essential to change.
By weaving together our  different experiences, we can shape a democracy that serves working people, where our labor is valued, and our food, water, and land is healthy.
Come on in, y’all we’ve got work to do.

Come on in y'all.
We’ve got work to do.
