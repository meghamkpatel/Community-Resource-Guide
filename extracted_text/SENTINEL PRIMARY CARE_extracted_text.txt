If you are looking for a new primary care physician in North Raleigh near Brier Creek or East Durham, please get in touch with Dr. Patrick O’Connell at Sentinel Primary Care in Brier Creek. As a direct primary care provider, Sentinel Primary Care offers unlimited acute, chronic, and preventive in-office medical visits for a flat monthly payment.

Lab work is discounted and additional.
Same-day or next-day appointments are usually available at the office in Brier Creek. If you’re looking for a “primary care provider near me,” Sentinel Primary Care may be a perfect match.
