The Durham Bicycle Cooperative is an all-volunteer 501(c)(3) nonprofit community bicycle project.
Our programming includes hands on repair skill share (helping you fix your bike), an earn-a-bike program (helping you get a bike), and Community Outreach clinics. Volunteers and donations are always welcome!
Support the Co-op!
Can you help us with a tax-deductible donation to support our mission?
The DBC is a 501(c)(3), so your donations are fully tax-deductible. We welcome monthly and one-time donations of any amount. Donors who give $250 and above will be listed on our website. Thank you for your generous support!
Prefer to donate by check? Please send checks made out to the Durham Bicycle Cooperative to PO Box 1225, Durham, NC 27702.
Get Your Membership!
Is it time to get your bike out of the garage? Join or renew your co-op membership! The cost of membership is only $30 per year and offers you access to the shop and co-op tools, assistance from our volunteer mechanics, and a fun, community environment.
Your membership helps us continue providing very affordable bikes and bicycle repair education to the Durham community.

In Memory of Mike Fink
We are heartbroken to announce that Co-op member and volunteer Mike Fink lost his battle with cancer. Mike was a long-time volunteer with our CWS program to help new political refugees earn bicycles to use for transportation, and he also volunteered for many youth bike activities in Durham.
Memorial donations made in honor of Mike will go toward our CWS and youth helmet programs. The Durham Bicycle Cooperative is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and donations are fully tax-deductible. Thank you for your support of the Durham Bicycle Cooperative.
