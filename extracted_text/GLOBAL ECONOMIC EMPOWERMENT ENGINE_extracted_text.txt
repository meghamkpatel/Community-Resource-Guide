Economic Development
The dividends of destination promotion extend far beyond the benefits accruing to visitor-related industries and their suppliers. In addition to attracting visitors, destination marketing drives broader economic growth by sustaining air service, creating familiarity, attracting decision makers, and improving the quality of life in a place.
As a result, cities and states that prioritize destination marketing and coordinate these efforts with economic development initiatives have experienced significant site relocations and new investments as a direct result.
