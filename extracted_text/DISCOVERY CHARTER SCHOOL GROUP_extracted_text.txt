It seems like when Discovery was planned, the administrators actually thought about what is important in a school rather than just doing what everyone else does. They recognize the value of having a school uniform, but they don't require a fancy/expensive/unpopular style. Students aren't just evaluated and left behind; the goal is to achieve mastery, which is how the real world works. IRL Fridays also reflect the reality of being in a digital world. -

The size of this school makes sure that our student doesn’t fall through the cracks. Parent input is highly valued.

We have been very happy with the smaller setting for our daughter who has an IEP who has been able to stay in the mainstream setting with EC support. She loves and is proud to be part of this school. The middle school counselors have been great and the Digital Arts class has been able to teach her so many creative things that have given her a sense of confidence in an area that isn’t always taught. The principal is so enthusiastic and has the best interests in mind for the kids. The EC department and the teachers work hard to help keep these kids’ confidence up. I really appreciate everyone, even how great the custodial staff is at this school! -
