ABOUT US
Chihuahua Rescue & Transport (CRT) is a non-profit organization dedicated to rescuing Chihuahuas and Chihuahua mixes. Through a network of dedicated volunteers, we rescue dogs throughout three regions (Midwest, Southeast, Southwest) and attend to their immediate medical, emotional and behavioral health.  Our goal is to place our rescues into approved forever homes or long-term foster care where they can live their best lives.

Consider becoming a foster
CRT relies on volunteers to foster our dogs. We do not house dogs in shelters. We can use your help! We carefully screen each foster home by application, reference checking (including vet) and a home visit. You must be 21 years of age. Your dogs/ cats must be spayed/neutered and receiving appropriate vet care (including vaccinations and heart-worm preventative). There are several additional requirements for fosters that will be discussed with individual applicants.
If you are interested, please fill out our Foster Application.

Join our team by volunteering!
The people who have volunteered their time and love for these wonderful dogs are a caring and responsive group. We are proud to have the pleasure of knowing each and every one. We welcome anyone who can give even a small amount of time to assist in any area. The joy of knowing a Chihuahua has found a “forever home” due to our efforts, either directly or indirectly, makes it all worthwhile.
We are always in need of volunteers. Please reach out to us or fill out a volunteer application.

Consider Donating
If you are not able to adopt or volunteer your time, there are many other ways to give.  Through our
Best Friends Sponsorship
program, you can select one or more dogs to sponsor. You can also donate “in honor” or “in memory” of someone.  There are also many ways to “give while you shop”.
We would not be able to function as an organization without the generosity of our donors.
If you are interested in contributing via a donation, see our
How to Donate
page for more information.

If interested, fill out an

. Fees are $300 for adults, $250 for seniors 10yo+, and $350 for puppies up to 1 year.
Most of our dogs come to us with medical issues or have not been spayed or neutered. We take care of all of their medical needs before we make them available for adoption. Adoption fees cover some of these costs:
$550 is our average vet bill per dog
$150 is our average transportation bill.
$40 is our average monthly drug cost per dog.

Be a Best Friend to our Most in Need
Some of our dogs need a best friend. These include ones that are forever fosters, on medications, hard to adopt, have special needs, where extra funds are needed. Won’t you consider making a
donation
to help one of these Chihuahuas? Once you donate any amount as a best friend, your name will be listed on their profile page as a donor.
