r/spirituality
Here, we discuss such things as personal transformation, the meaning of life, death, and moments of clarity. There is no single, widely-agreed definition of spirituality.
Many people gravitate toward spirituality to seek religious-like understandings without the ideological constraints of institutional religion.
This community, however, is open to everyone, religious and non-religious alike.
Join us in finding our place in the universe. ðŸŒŒ

Uplifting Humanity
There was once a youtube channel called Uplifting Humanity.  Now, that youtube channel is gone.  It has been gone for a few weeks and I've been missing it for a while, but I'm just now getting around to posting about it on reddit.
My morning routine included rewatching an old video of his - it didn't matter which one.  If he had a new one posted when I woke up and had time to watch youtube, then I'd watch it.  I even purchased a few of his audiofiles, so I guess I could go and re-listen to those.
His messages made my day a little better.
I really do miss Billy Heartbeing.  Where is he?  Why did he take all of his lovely content down?
