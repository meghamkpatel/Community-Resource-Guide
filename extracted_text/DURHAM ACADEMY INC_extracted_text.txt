The DA Story
Eighth-grade civics classes have been abuzz all year long — researching community issues of importance to them and then using class time to turn their ideas into real, tangible and impactful community engagement projects.
Videographer Jesse Paddock has documented their work over the course of the school year and takes us inside the Durham Challenge, where DA students learn about their ability to affect meaningful, lasting change.

Mission
The purpose of a Durham Academy education is to prepare each student to live a moral, happy and productive life. The development of intellect is central to such a life and, thus, intellectual endeavor and growth are the primary work of the school. The acquisition of knowledge; the development of skills, critical judgment and intellectual curiosity; and increased understanding are the goals of the school's academic program.
Durham Academy admits students of any race, color, national and ethnic origin to all the rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to students at the school. Durham Academy does not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, national and ethnic origin in administration of its education policies, financial aid programs, athletics or other school-administered programs.
