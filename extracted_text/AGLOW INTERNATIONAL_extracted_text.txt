Revival in the midst of Trouble
2023-conference.jpg
Aglow is a dynamic, global Kingdom movement made up of women and men with a single purpose: to see God's will done on earth as it is in Heaven.
We do this by raising up champions and warriors across the earth who will bring freedom to the oppressed while providing opportunities for everyone in our spheres of influence to grow into radiant relationships with each other, as well as, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

Who Are We?
As the Aglow staff watched Dutch Sheets' Sunday morning message from St. Louis during our weekly Headquarters staff meeting, Jane stopped the video at a particular place and said, “This needs to be shared as far and wide as possible.” What could Dutch say that would move Jane so powerfully? Listen in and hear as Dutch defines who Aglow is in the earth and encourages us to step into the massive call God has for us in the nations of the world. Our prophetic words are connecting to their moment and are coming into focus right in front of our eyes.
