What do we do?
Open Table Ministry walks alongside people experiencing homelessness in Durham, NC.
Our goal is to end homelessness by building relationships within our community, allowing for a holistic approach in caring for our unsheltered neighbors.
OTM was incorporated as a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization in 2009.
Why do we do it?
More than 300 people are experiencing homelessness in Durham right now and need immediate support.
Each person experiencing homelessness is a part of our neighborhood. We believe supporting
all
of
our neighbors means working to provide opportunities for everyone to access safe and affordable housing.
How do we do it?
We meet people where they are: on the streets, in shelter, or at our front door to offer long-term, individualized support.
Our weekly programming addresses immediate needs and offers long-term support by providing Free Store, transportation, case management, and much more!
Make a donation.

“If you make sure that the hungry and oppressed have all that they need, then your light will shine in the darkness, and even your bleakest moments will be bright as a clear day.”
— Isaiah 58
Our volunteers make our work possible.
Other than a small team of paid staff members, Open Table Ministry relies entirely on the kindness and actions of volunteers. We can’t do it without you!
You can make a real difference in the lives of your neighbors. We serve more than 150 people every week at Open Table Ministry. Please join us in helping to feed, clothe, and build relationships with some of the most vulnerable in Durham. A few minutes of your time can make a
lasting impact
on someone's life.
