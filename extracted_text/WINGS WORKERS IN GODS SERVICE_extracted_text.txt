WINGS
Women in God's Service
Monthly Fellowship Opportunities for Women at Calvary
WINGS (Women In God's Service) exists to provide the women of Calvary Lutheran Church with opportunities to use their unique talents and abilities in service to Christ. Through monthly gatherings and ongoing projects, we seek to:
Help women grow in grace and truth through Bible study.
Remember those in need.
Cultivate God-pleasing fellowship within Calvary's congregation.
Serve Calvary's congregation and its leaders.
Serve in the work of the WELS Synod and its mission work through the Lutheran Women’s Missionary Society (LWMS).
Bible Study Gatherings
WINGS gathers monthly to grow in God's word together. Bible study topics are chosen to deepen faith, grow in unity, and encourage women in their daily walk with Christ.
Bible Study Schedule:
January 13, 2024 - 9:30 AM
February 10, 2024 - 9:30 AM

Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful. And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds.
Hebrews 10:23-24
