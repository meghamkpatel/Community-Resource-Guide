Science of Reading
Math
Executive Function
LD & ADHD
Hill has developed a robust portfolio of self-paced online courses to support any educatorâs science of reading journey. In addition, Hill offers 95 RAP, an individualized, small-group reading intervention supported by technology and quality professional development.
Science of Reading
Hillâs approach to math combines the deep knowledge of national experts with the practical experience of Hill teachers. As with our reading and writing methodology, we incorporate the Orton-Gillingham approach and place an emphasis on explicit, systematic, multisensory instruction to develop mastery.
Math Strategies
Most students could benefit from more explicit, intentional strategies and supports for developing their executive function skills. Hill has taken the time-tested approaches integrated into our schoolâs methodology and developed practical, effective custom workshops.
Executive Function
With over 45 years of experience helping students with diagnosed learning differences and attention challenges become confident, independent learners, Hill has a wealth of research-based, practical expertise to share with other educators and families. Our self-paced, custom, and in-person offerings can standalone, be bundled together, or be tailored to meet your needs.
LD & ADHD
Individual Tutoring
Hill Tutoring offers individual instruction in the subjects of Reading, Writing, and Math in a 1:1 format for students in grades K-12. Hill Tutors are trained in our methodology and receive ongoing professional development.

What are learning differences?
Learning differences are the unique and individual ways in which some people process new information. In the United States, one in five students has a learning difference, meaning they experience challenges with organization, memory, or attention, especially in academics, such as reading, writing, and math. While everyone in the population may struggle with these skills at some point or another, students with learning differences experience these difficulties throughout their educational development, and they can last an entire lifetime.
