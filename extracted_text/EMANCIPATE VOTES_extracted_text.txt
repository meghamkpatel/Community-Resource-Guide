District Attorneys
District Attorneys (DAs) wield tremendous and often unchecked power. Through their day-to-day decisions, DAs have the power to reduce local prison populations, eliminate the use of the death penalty, work to improve racial equity, and truly hold police accountable when they kill, injure, or otherwise violate someone’s constitutional rights.

Judges
The judicial system is full of racial disparities due to the current actions and decisions made every day by Superior Court judges, District Court judges, and magistrates across North Carolina. Judges and magistrates have the power to end the practice of setting cash bail, set the rules to ensure fair trials, and and make truly equitable judgments for all who enter the justice system.

Mayors & City Council Members
With the power of purse strings and appointments, mayors and city council members can have a big impact on how your local community dollars are spent. In terms of police accountability, the mayor and city council have the power to decide how local police departments are funded, and choose to fund alternative, community-led safety initiatives.
