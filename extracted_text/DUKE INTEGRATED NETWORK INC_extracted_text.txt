What
is Duke Connected Care?
Duke Connected Care (DCC) is a physician-led,
clinically-integrated network (CIN)
that aims to improve the quality of healthcare while addressing the national challenge of rising healthcare costs. A CIN is a group of doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers who have elected to partner with health plans to give higher-quality, more coordinated service and care to a group of assigned patients.
Duke Connected Care currently partners with the following plans:
Medicare
, as an
Accountable Care Organization (ACO)
As a Medicare member visiting a Duke Connected Care provider, your current benefits will not change—and you will still have the right to choose any doctor or hospital that accepts Medicare, at any time. Please visit
Medicare.gov/ACOs
or call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) for general questions or additional information about accountable care organizations (TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048).
