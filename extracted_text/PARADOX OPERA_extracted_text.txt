“Paradox Opera’s praiseworthy mission to bridge the gap, reinterpret classic operas, and commission new works reflects a commitment to reaching a diverse audience. Joining them was more than a professional collaboration; it was an invitation to a vibrant community where the old and new converge, breathing fresh life into opera!”
-Christopher Fotis, PXO Artist
“Paradox Opera is a wonderful young company that treats their artists with respect and pays them fairly. PXO produces shows that push the envelope in an accessible way.”
- Marissa Simmons, PXO Artist
“Beautiful costumes and a cozy set provided for a wonderful backdrop to tell the story and the singing was powerful… I was most impressed and can't wait for the next production.  Hats off to everyone involved!”
- David Edwards, PXO Super Fan!
“I thoroughly enjoyed the show, great music and audience engagement, opera doesn’t need to be stuffy and can connect with people!”
- A PXO Fan
“Alissa Roca had excellent tone and poise as Mother, while Governor Harris (he/him), Gwendolyn Hyland (she/they), and Miguel Pedroza (he/him) were truly the highlights of the show with their well-blended harmonies as the three kings.”
- Lauren Lisinski, Chatham Life and Style
“I loved the show. Each performer, and the incredible pianist, are clearly accomplished, talented, committed, and also having a wonderful time both with us as audience members, and with each other. I really loved the format of a mixture of opera and contemporary pieces. I really applaud this exciting endeavor, and feel like it has a really wonderful addition to the local art scene.”
- A PXO Fan
