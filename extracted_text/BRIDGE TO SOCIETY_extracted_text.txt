FORGING A MORE CARING FUTURE

I was approached to run the United Way campaign at Elliott. While I was enthusiastic about the opportunity, I only developed true appreciation later as I had the opportunity to interact with the United Way agencies that work in the community.

United Way offers me opportunities to learn about people that I wouldn’t normally connect with in my everyday life, and I appreciate that. It has opened my eyes and heart to so many people within our great community.

I volunteer with United Way because it’s a great way to give back and engage with the community, especially with our campus community. It’s fun coming up with creative ways for people to give back to agencies that are important to them.

Being involved with United Way is just a small way that I can give back, and hopefully provide those resources—and that network—for others.

Building community creates a sense of pride and positivity that can be spread onto others. The more that’s spread, the better we can build and support one another.

I volunteer with United Way because I think my time is as equally as important as what I’m able to donate financially. I love volunteering with United Way, specifically because I can involve my family!
