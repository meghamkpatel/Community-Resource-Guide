Known
and Loved
Trinity’s caring teachers and staff and our smaller classes make it possible for each student to be truly known and loved as a unique individual, created in God’s image, with his or her own passions and talents, challenges, and strengths.
Philip James
Class of '10
I’m excited Trinity is growing. I was in the first graduating class, and I’m happy that there are many more teachers and students in the Upper School. Trinity is still offering Greek, Latin, Robotics, and other special courses but keeping the strong components of Christian life. The teachers are incredible. Trinity  continues to hire qualified, talented faculty who enjoy young people and are passionate about teaching.
Georgina Keene
Parent of Alumna
A kindergarten to twelfth grade Trinity education for our daughter has been the best investment my husband and I have ever made. Our daughter has flourished at Trinity School. Her teachers have influenced and shaped not only her strong academic foundation, but more importantly, her character and her love of learning. As a Board member, I have experienced first-hand the integrity and wholehearted devotion of the leadership at this school. I feel privileged to be a part of the Trinity community.
Spencer Dicks
Middle School History Teacher
I am now in my 12th year here at Trinity. I am immensely grateful for the relationships I have made with students and colleagues over these years and the ways those relationships have shaped me personally and professionally. In short, not only am I deeply invested in Trinity, but I feel that Trinity is deeply invested in its students and teachers.
Ellie Winters
Class of '18
The best thing in my 13-year Trinity life has been the relationships with the classmates I have studied, played, learned, and laughed with for a little over a decade. These friends are some of the best people I have ever known. My relationships with my teachers have meant so much to me. Middle and Upper School can be very hard times for students, and being able to simply have casual conversations with your teachers helps to lighten the load. I hope that future students will be able to enjoy these kinds of relationships.

Gail Powery
Parent and Trinity Parent Organization Volunteer
Trinity has reminded me that it takes a village to raise and educate our children. It takes committed faculty and staff in partnership with parents to nurture our children toward academic, social, and spiritual flourishing. Education requires the dedication of an entire community. Trinity is a team like no other.
