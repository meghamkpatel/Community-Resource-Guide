A Transformative Experience
At Empowered Minds, we move beyond the conventional tools of lectures, homework, high-stakes tests, and grades. Our learners collaborate in mixed-age studios. This flexible approach challenges each learner with their individualized learning plan, coupled with real-world projects and experiences.
Above all else,
OUR MISSION
is that each child that enters our doors begins a journey to discover their unique gifts and passions, and how they can be used to serve others and find a calling that will change the world.

We're proud to be an Acton!
Experience how Acton is transforming education in this independent, award-winning documentary.
Empowered Minds is one of 300+ Acton Academies around the world.
This proven model allows learners to practice and develop the skills they really need: critical thinking, group collaboration, conflict resolution, decision-making, and problem-solving. These, along with “soft skills” like self-discipline, emotion regulation, self-awareness, and grit, position our children to tackle anything.
It’s an innovative approach to education that celebrates personal responsibility, creative freedom, and the pursuit of one’s life purpose.

were
, who we
are
