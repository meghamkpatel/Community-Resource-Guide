How does 2nd Chance work for SuperLotto Plus
®
and Fantasy 5?
Every SuperLotto Plus ticket has a 2nd Chance code that grants 1 entry for each $1 spent into the weekly SuperLotto Plus 2nd Chance drawings. There are 5 prizes, and the more money you play, the more entries you get. For example, if you play $5 on a single ticket, your 2nd Chance code will be good for 5 draw entries.
Every $5 Fantasy 5 ticket has a 2nd Chance code for 1 entry into the weekly Fantasy 5 – 2nd Chance drawing. There are 15 prizes, and the more money you play, the more entries you get. For example, if you play $15 on a single ticket, your 2nd Chance code will award 3 draw entries.
How long will it take to get my 2nd Chance prize?
Allow 8 weeks to receive your prize. If you have any questions, just call the Lottery’s Customer Service Department at 1-800-LOTTERY (1-800-568-8379), Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., and we’ll be happy to help you.
How will I know how many 2nd Chance codes I’ve entered?
Your Lottery account shows you, in real time, how many 2nd Chance codes you’ve entered that month. The system won’t let you submit more than 500 2nd Chance codes a month.
How will I know if I’m a Lottery winner?
If you win, you’ll be notified by email to sign into your Lottery account for “important information.” When you log in, you’ll be notified about your prize and a link to a 2nd Chance Winner Claim Form.
I signed up for a Lottery account, so why can’t I enter 2nd Chance draws?
Only verified accounts that have confirmed their email can submit codes. To activate your verified account, the Lottery needs to confirm your email address. Just find the Lottery verification email in your inbox and follow the simple instructions.
If I enter a 2nd Chance code eligible for 2 different draws, does it count as 2 of my 500 monthly entries?
No. It only counts as 1 of your 500 monthly submissions for 2nd Chance. Each code you enter just counts as 1 submission.
Is it OK to throw away my 2nd Chance codes after I enter them into the drawing?
We recommend keeping your 2nd Chance codes until the draw is over, just in case there’s a question about one of them. Throwing your 2nd Chance codes away doesn’t disqualify you from drawings, and you don’t need your original ticket to claim your prize, but you’re ultimately responsible for the 2nd Chance codes you’ve submitted.
My Lottery verification email isn’t in my inbox. Now what?
If you don’t see your Lottery verification email, check your junk/spam folder. Add us to your safe senders list so this doesn’t happen in the future.
What are my odds of winning 2nd Chance?
Your odds of winning depend on the total number of entries, the number of entries you’ve submitted and the number of prizes awarded for each draw.
What happens if I submit my 2nd Chance code after the deadline?
If you submit your 2nd Chance code after the entry deadline at 11:59 p.m. Saturday, it will automatically be entered into the following week’s draw. Your entry is only good for one weekly draw.
What is a verified account?
To ensure the integrity of your account, the Lottery uses age/identity verification technology to validate your information. To participate in registered player benefits like 2nd Chance and Jackpot Captain and confirm your eligibility to win a promotional or 2nd Chance prize, players must provide the following information:
Full legal name (first and last name)
Valid California street address (including city, state and zip code)
Date of birth (to ensure you’re 18 or older and can legally play the Lottery)
It is the Lottery’s policy to limit the collection of personal information and protect the personal information we collect and maintain.
What is an active 2nd Chance account?
An active 2nd Chance account is one that a user can log into and has not been closed, deleted, or submitted for closure/deletion.
What happens to my entries if I delete my 2nd Chance account?
Any submissions into pending draws will no longer be eligible to win because the account is no longer active.
How can I suspend or delete my Lottery account?
You have two options: Suspend your account, or delete your account.
Suspend - Your account will be suspended, but your profile information will be retained – so you can reactivate your account whenever you wish.
