Accounting Codes Overview
Purpose
General Overview
Company Code
Cost Object
G/L Account
I. PURPOSE
This overview is designed to provide a general understanding of the various types of accounting codes as well as to provide details regarding the logic of the structure of the cost object numbers.
II. GENERAL OVERVIEW
The University and Health System use a series of codes to identify various entities.
The highest-level identification is the
Company Code
. The Company Code is a four-digit code that identifies a separate accounting entity within the SAP system. A detailed listing of the company codes follows in
section III
.
The next level of identification indicates the departmental position within the company code structure. For the University this is a ten-digit number called the
Org. Code or the BFR
. For the Health System this is an eight-digit number called the
Hierarchy Area
. (You can display your Org. Code or Hierarchy Area in SAP. Refer to your training manual for instructions).
Cost objects
are the “fund” level of identification. A cost object can be a profit center, cost center, WBS element, fund or internal order.
Section IV
provides detailed information regarding the logic and organization of cost objects.
Within a cost object, the type of transaction is identified using a six-digit
G/L account
. Detailed descriptions of the G/L accounts can be found on the
G/L Account Definitions
page.

IV. COST OBJECT
The cost object is the number that identifies the “fund”. The University (
Section A
) uses a seven-digit cost object for most of the types of cost objects, and a nine-digit cost object for newer projects in the Restricted Fund Group (see below). The Health System (
Section B
) uses a nine-digit cost object. Cost object is the generic term for a profit center, cost center, WBS element, fund, or internal order.
Section C
identifies the prefixes for internal orders.
A. UNIVERSITY COST OBJECT STRUCTURE
In company code 0010, the first digit of the number structure is called the Fund Group. The major fund groupings for the University are:
0xxxxxx:
Pooled Cash and Securities Fund
1xxxxxx:
Current Unrestricted Funds
2xxxxxx:
Current Restricted Funds
3xxxxxx and 3xxxxxxxx:
Current Restricted Funds
Axxxxxx:
Current Restricted Funds
4xxxxxx:
Current Unrestricted Funds - Allocated
5xxxxxx:
Loan Funds
6xxxxxx:
Endowment Funds
7xxxxxx:

2. CURRENT UNRESTRICTED FUND
(1001000 fund, 1xx-14x profit centers and 15x-190 cost centers)
The Current Unrestricted Fund represents Duke University's general operating funds earned by or given to the University free of any restrictions imposed by outside agencies. The annual budget process allocates the unrestricted income of the University to the various departments or programs for operations during the current year.
The second and third digits of the Current Unrestricted Fund sequence convey the source or purpose of the cost object as follows:
1001000 - ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND FUND EQUITY (Funds)
Most Current Unrestricted assets, liabilities, and fund equity are recorded in fund 1001000. No revenue or expense is ever recorded in this fund.
REVENUE FUNDS (Profit Centers)
11xxxxx through 140xxxx are used to record all Current Unrestricted Fund revenue received during the current fiscal year.
11xxxxx - Educational and General Revenue:
111xxxx Income from Students:
These profit centers include all tuition and fees charged to students for educational and general purposes, net of cancellations. Remissions or exemptions of tuition and fees should not reduce tuition and fees revenue. Such remissions or exemptions should be recorded as expenditures under the category Student Aid, (168xxxx).
112xxxx Endowment Income:
These profit centers include unrestricted income distributed from Endowment Funds.
113xxxx Gift Income:
These profit centers include all unrestricted gifts received during the current fiscal year.
114xxxx Recovery of Indirect Cost:
These profit centers include funds received as a recovery of indirect costs accruing from sponsored research and other sponsored programs.
116xxxx Organized Activities Relating to Educational Departments:
These profit centers represent all revenue earned by programs and activities, which support the educational departments.
117xxxx Investment Income:
These profit centers include all revenue earned through investment of Current Unrestricted Funds.
118xxxx Unassigned Income Transfers:
These represent each School’s share of unassigned income (The Duke Endowment, Unrestricted Quasi Endowment and Investment Income). These codes are for Budget Office use only.
119xxxx Other Revenue Sources:
These profit centers include all revenue received for educational and general purposes not reported elsewhere.
140xxxx Auxiliary Enterprises Revenue:
These profit centers include all revenue earned by the University's Auxiliary Enterprises. An auxiliary enterprise is a self-supporting activity primarily serving students, faculty, and staff by providing goods and services for a fee or sales price related to the cost of goods and services. The majority of the revenue comes from sources outside the University not from University departments. Examples of auxiliary revenue include charges for room, board, revenue earned from intercollegiate athletic programs, and revenue from Duke University Press operations.
EXPENDITURE FUNDS (Cost Centers)
15xxxxx to 19xxxxx cost centers are used to record all Current Unrestricted Fund expenditures during the current fiscal year.
15xxxxx - Educational and General Expense
151xxxx Instruction and Departmental Research:
These cost centers include all expenditures of the departments, colleges, schools and other instructional divisions of the University. This category includes compensation for deans (to the extent their work is academic-oriented), faculty members, secretaries, technicians, laboratory and other assistants; office expenses; laboratory and other instructional expenses; expenditures for capital equipment; other operating expenses; and research expenditures not separately budgeted or financed.
152xxxx Organized Activities Relating to Educational Departments:
These cost centers include the gross expenditures of programs and activities, which support the educational departments but are not full-fledged departments.
153xxxx Other Separately Budgeted Research:
These cost centers include all budgeted expenditures for research.
Note: This category does not include departmental research (research not separately budgeted or financed); these expenditures should be included under Instruction and Departmental Research (151xxxx).
154xxxx Libraries:
These cost centers include all expenditures for libraries, both general and departmental. Such expenditures include those for salaries, wages, books, subscriptions, binding costs and other operating expenses.
155xxxx Student Services:
These cost centers include all expenditures for services to students. This category includes the registrar's office, admissions office, offices of the deans of students, guidance and testing programs, health service, financial aid office and all University subsidies to student activities.
156xxxx Operation and Maintenance of Physical Plant:
These cost centers include all expenses for salaries and wages, supplies, materials, equipment, and other similar expenses for the operating and maintenance of the University physical plant. Expenditures of this nature, which are incurred on behalf of the Auxiliary Enterprises, are deducted from this category by means of an expense credit or cost accounting distribution and reported under expenditures of these organizations.
157xxxx General Administration:
These cost centers include all expenditures of the general executive and administrative offices serving the entire University. Expenditures of this nature, which are incurred on behalf of the Auxiliary Enterprises, are deducted from this category by means of an expense credit or cost accounting distribution and reported under expenditures of these organizations.
168xxxx Student Aid Expenses:
These cost centers represent expenditures for student aid, including tuition remissions other than those made under the University's tuition grant program (which are included in Fringe Benefits). It should also be noted that financial assistance granted to students contingent upon their performing a service does not constitute Student Aid, but should be reported under Instruction and Departmental Research (151xxxx) using the appropriate payroll G/L Account (i.e., series 60xxxx).
180xxxx Auxiliary Enterprises Expenses:
These cost centers represent all expenditures of the University's Auxiliary Enterprises. An auxiliary enterprise is a self-supporting activity primarily serving students, faculty, and staff by providing goods and services for a fee or sales price related to the cost of goods and services.
19xxxxx Appropriations and Transfers:
These cost centers have been established to record all appropriations and transfers from the Current Unrestricted Fund to other fund groups. Transactions recorded in these funds do not represent revenue or expenditures but rather (1) an assignment by the Board of Trustees of a portion of the unrestricted revenue of the Current Unrestricted Fund or (2) the reallocation or reclassification of revenue or accumulated surplus from one fund to another fund.
The last four digits of the Current Unrestricted Fund are numbers assigned to individual cost objects.

3. CURRENT RESTRICTED FUNDS
(3xxxxxx or 3xxxxxxxx, 2xxxxxx & Axxxxxx WBS elements)
Current Restricted Funds represent funds received by Duke University subject to outside agency restrictions that specify the manner in which the funds are to be used in current operations. These funds are cost objects that fall in the category of WBS Elements and may be all digits or alph-numeric. Examples of these funds include gifts designated by the donor for scholarship and fellowship purposes; grants from foundations, industries, individuals, and governmental bodies for research projects; and income from the investment of endowed funds, which have been restricted by the donor as to its use. WBS Elements for Current Restricted Funds created as of 10/1/21 are nine-digits in length, and those created prior to 10/1/21 are 7-digits or 7 alpha-numeric characters in length.  As funds are closed, eventually all Current Restricted Funds will be nine-digits in length.
Regardless of whether the WBS Element for Current Restricted Funds is seven digits or a newer nine digit structure, the second digit in the Current Restricted Funds sequence indicates the funding source, as outlined below:
20x, 30x & A0x - Department of Health & Human Services (DHHS):
This includes contracts and grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health, the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration, and other divisions of the Department of Health & Human Services.

28x & 38x - Non-Governmental - Requiring Reports or meeting other criteria:
This includes awards made by foundations, private universities, industry, individuals or other non-governmental organizations that meet at least one of the following criteria:
Financial reporting is required.  Financial reporting includes:
An accounting (as documented on an invoice or financial report) of how funds were spent, i.e., either a summary or details of expenses;
or
A restriction on how the funds are expended;
It DOES NOT include a simple reconciliation of funds due from the sponsor versus payments received from the sponsor.
Agreement includes the flow-through of federal or other governmental funds OR the inclusion of federally based award terms/conditions, such as agency specific federal language/references or citing the Uniform Guidance (i.e., 2 CFR Part 200).
Sponsor requires the return of unspent funds, as this implies the sponsor requires a final accounting of expenses.
Non-industry sponsor, invoicing is required, and none of the above criteria apply.
Please note, 28x & 38x WBS elements will be invoiced centrally by Office of Sponsored Programs and/or Treasury Billing Services.
29x & 39x - Non-Governmental - Not Requiring Reports or meeting other criteria:
This includes awards made by foundations, industry, individuals or other non-governmental, organizations which do not require periodic financial reports on the activities of the funds or meet any of the other criteria listed for 28x & 38x WBS elements. Please note, invoicing for 29x & 39x WBS elements is the responsibility of the department that received the award.
Regardless of whether the WBS Element for Current Restricted Funds is seven digits or a newer nine digit structure, the third digit in the Current Restricted Funds sequence indicates the WBS element's primary purpose, as outlined below:
2x1 & 3x1 - Instruction and Departmental Research:
This includes those funds whose primary purpose is the support of instruction, departmental research and/or professorships. Instruction includes those activities offered through regular academic departments or separate divisions, such as summer school, whether they are offered for credit towards a degree or on a non-credit basis. Instruction, course and curriculum development, academic advising and scholarly activities such as preparing papers, delivering papers, attending seminars and professional society meetings are also included. Pursuing one's own professional interest through research, writing, etc. is known as departmental research and is included. Departmental research is not separately budgeted or accounted for. Also included in this category are funds that have been designated for endowed professorships.
3x2 - Training Programs:
This includes those funds whose primary purpose is the support of training activities. Training activities can be defined as the cost of teaching students or employees the professional skills necessary to engage in research or in the techniques and practices pertinent to the delivery of specific services in a particular area of concern. Training projects are those designed to produce skilled manpower in specific fields, disciplines or specialties.
2x3, 3x3, & Ax3 - Sponsored Research
This includes those funds whose primary purpose is the support of sponsored research, including clinical trials. Sponsored research includes all research and development activities of the University that are separately budgeted, accounted for, and organized with definite research objectives.

This includes those funds whose primary purpose is the support of various library activities.
3x5 - Student Services:
This includes those funds whose primary purpose is the support of components rendering services to students.

This includes those funds whose primary purpose is the support of the general administration and operations of the University.  This includes construction/renovation grants and equipment grants.
3x8 - Student Aid:
This includes those funds whose primary purpose is the granting of aid to students in such forms as scholarships, fellowships, grants-in-aid, stipends, etc.
3x9 - Other Sponsored Activities:
This includes those funds whose primary purpose is (1) the support of other programs which are not more appropriately included in one of the categories outlined above or (2) which are multipurpose funds not having a predominate purpose. Indiscriminate use of this series of cost objects is discouraged; this series should be used only when it is clearly inappropriate to establish a WBS element in one of the preceding categories.
The last four to six digits of the Current Restricted Fund represent numbers assigned to individual WBS elements within this fund group. WBS Elements created in the Fund Group as of 10/1/21 are nine-digit values to provide the same sight intelligence are used in the past, plus a more expansive range of numbers available in the 3xx range.
