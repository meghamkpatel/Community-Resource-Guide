STAF SUMMER OPEN HOUSE – JUNE 23
Join us for our Summer Open House on Sunday, June 23, from 2-5pm! Please mark your calendars and spread the word to friends and family members. Our Open House gives our volunteers the opportunity to show off the wonderful work we do every day, 365 days of the year, and we are so very proud of our accomplishments.
If the people in your lives are always wondering what the allure and attraction is for so many of us who are committed and dedicated to our dogs and cats, please invite them to be a part of the fun and festivities. We will keep you updated in the coming months, but for now, spread the word, and save the date for purrs and wags!
​THANK YOU, CINCY LIFESTYLE!
A big thank you to Cincy Lifestyle for featuring STAF and the life-saving care that we provide to our animals. Thanks to volunteer Alex C. for an amazing job representing STAF in the video! Check it out!
​THANK YOU, THE THINK SHOP, FOR YOUR DAY OF SERVICE
Thank you to our friends from The Think Shop for volunteering with us, offering a day of service. Since these team members “strive to be a passionate bunch who have a relentless drive for creativity and a commitment to discovery”, they certainly proved their determination by helping with some nitty gritty cleaning around our shelter.
Hosted by volunteers, Diane, Donna, and Mike, it was a group effort with results that served to benefit our volunteers and our animals. We are very grateful for all of the help we received, and when all was said and done at the end of a busy work day, it was time to receive a proper “thank you” from our animals!
THANK YOU, UC STUDENTS
Thank you students Kylee and Karina for organizing the sticker sale at UC to benefit our shelter. Despite the dreary weather, we were able to introduce some of our dogs to many of the students who were in attendance and we made so many wonderful new friends who will spread the word about the great work we do at STAF.
​THANK YOU, INDIAN HILL MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENT COUNCIL
It seems that love was surely in the air at Indian Hill Middle School as their students so generously participated in a Valentine’s Day Campaign to raise money for our dogs and cats! The seventh and eighth graders, led by Savannah, eighth grade teacher and student council staff advisor, raised over one thousand dollars by selling candy grams in support of our shelter. According to Savannah, the council, “chose STAF because they appreciate our values and love of our furry friends.”
We are certainly honored by those kind words, and indeed, these funds will go to our Medical Fund, lovingly offering every amenity that our precious population deserves. We cannot express our offering of thanks better than lots of tail wags and appreciation from doggie Alana!
THANK YOU, GIRL SCOUT TROOP #4343
We were delighted to host Girl Scout Troop #4343 as they helped us with canned food feedings for our cats. Because some of our resident cats require extra calories, our visitors learned the importance of good nutrition for healthy coats, shiny eyes, and loud purrs. After the work was done, it was time to get lots of thank you time from their new furry friends.
With full feline tummies, the girls’ laps and hearts were equally full, and they shared who their favorites were. A fun time for all, and since sponsorships are a way to help, some of the girls filled out forms so they could keep up with their new special friends, with three of the girls sharing “joint custody” of room 23 resident, Cecil. Thank you, for your love and spirit!
