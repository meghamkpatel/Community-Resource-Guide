Our Vision
Kingdom Harvest Ministries has a desire to see the hearts and lives of young people changed through the saving power of Jesus Christ.
Our goal is to partner with schools, churches, and parents to help build a better generation of students, youth, and workers! We know that students are bombarded in this day and age on social media, TV, their phones, and within their schools with negative influences.Â  Our goal is to partner with the community to help address these negative influences and help build a stronger youth culture that builds each other up,  works hard, and follows the example of Jesus.
We believe Released Time Bible Education is the best way to encourage youth of all ages.

Churches
At face value, many would think that release time Bible education has no value to a local church body. At Kingdom Harvest Ministries, we aim to make an impact in the the community at large, which includes the church. We understand the power of unity in the body of Christ, so we aim to unify the local churches in a community under the goal of spreading the Kingdom of God to our students.

Schools
Schools today have a goal to educate their students with what they believe are the building blocks to create a successful future as they go onto adulthood. We at KHM agree, and believe that the main building block for life, not just adulthood, is a relationship with Jesus Christ. We want to allow every students in our communities to hear and learn what about the Chief Cornerstone described in the Bible as Jesus himself.

Parents
As a parent, you would want your child to grow, learn, and go throughout life with an understanding of who they are and what their purpose is on this world. These are some of the biggest questions that students have to answer, and at KHM we aim to answer these questions. Unfortunately, the culture of schools can be in opposition to principles parents are trying to instill in their children at home. We want to partner with parents to emphasize the moral and Godly principles that are being challenged in our students lives on a daily basis.
