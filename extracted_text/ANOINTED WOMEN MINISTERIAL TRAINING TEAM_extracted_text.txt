Preparation and Renovation by clifton l. powell
“ Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving let your
requests be made known to God; ”

We invite you to rise with the Son each morning on our
Day – By – Day Prayer Line.
God has granted so many blessings through our eager willingness to praise, worship and celebrate the goodness of the Lord our Father.

Recent Testimony from the Wife of Deacon Ricky Hawkins:
Thank you for being a Spiritual Blessing to Ricky.
He has had a renewal spirit since talking to you all. He can’t stop talking to everyone about how you all blessed him with your words of wisdom and encouragement. And I thank God for your vision to have a platform for him to share his testimony.
