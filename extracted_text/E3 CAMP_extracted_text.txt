What happens at E3 Camp?
​​
Students will be exposed to the work (current and historical) of black scientists, inventors, and artists through hands-on experiences of electricity, solar power, coding, forensics, poetry/spoken word, engineering design, math, music, aerodynamics, and videography that engage curiosity, observation and imagination. We explore science/technology on a local level through the variety of ways they’re used by community workers.
