Trinity Park is one of
Durham’s
oldest central neighborhoods
Welcome to Trinity Park, located between downtown and Duke University’s East Campus. Within 40 square blocks of tree-lined streets, the neighborhood is filled with historic homes and buildings, earning Trinity Park a place on the National Register of Historic Districts.
The Trinity Park Neighborhood Association (TPNA) is one of Durham’s oldest and most active neighborhood associations. TPNA has been integral in building community, preserving historic architecture, working with the city on smart development, and keeping the neighborhood safe and enjoyable for all neighbors. We encourage all residents to
join TPNA
and contribute to our vibrant community.
