Jobs
We have built a staff with over 100 years of experience in the industry, as well as our industry intelligence and expertise in working with Historically Black Colleges and Universities.
In order to move our staff to this new fee-for-service structure model, we had to make changes in our organizational structure to provide more authority to the Program Directors. Each Program Director became more involved, with not only managing their staff, but also their budgets and expected outcomes. In addition, the administrative staff now provides support services to achieve the goals of the program.
Our focus was on:
Operational Excellence
Program Success
Fundraising
Leadership Development
