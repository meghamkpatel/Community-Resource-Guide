About Triangle House
Of the many symbols that resonate in LGBTQIA+ communities, the triangle holds a special significance. In the mathematical form of the Delta, the triangle represents change, a characteristic that defines the LGBTQIA+ fight for social equality and social justice. A profound metaphor for the resiliency of LGBTQIA+ communities, the triangle is the only geometric shape impervious to distortion and deformation.
The upside-down version of the triangle is a reminder of the LGBTQIA+ community’s painful history during the holocaust. Originally intended as a badge of shame, the pink triangle and black triangle have been reclaimed as international symbols of gay pride and lesbian pride.
You do not have to identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer to live in Triangle House. It is open to any student, whether LGBTQIA+ or Ally identified, who wants to deepen their understanding of these topics.
Learning Objectives
The aim of the Triangle House program is to enhance the intellectual and cultural environment of the Dartmouth College campus with particular regard to issues that pertain to the historical and contemporary experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, aromantic, and allied people by accomplishing the following learning objectives:
Community
– Foster a strong sense of community and well-being among LGBTQIA+ students, based on mutual accountability and respect.
Knowledge
– Develop knowledge of LGBTQIA+ histories, identities, culture, and politics.
Action
– Increase exposure to and experiential practice of contemporary models of social justice organizing, service, and action.
Residency Expectations
Residents living in Triangle House are expected to make a commitment to building an accountable and action-oriented community as well as engaging in the scholarly pursuit of LGBTQIA+ topics.
To ensure your success in meeting these objectives, you are expected to:
Attend the house orientation meeting.
Demonstrate commitment to the residential community by attending 6 discussion-based house meals per term. Residents will sign up for rotating responsibilities including cooking, set up, and clean up.
Participate in termly reflection where residents will share with each other how they have translated knowledge into action.
Participate in a termly House Day.
Additional ideas for engagement:
Complete one or many courses that:
Focus(es) primarily on LGBTQIA+ topics.
Cover(s) some LGBTQIA+ scholarship and content.
Allow(s) for independent research or coursework on LGBTQIA+ topics.
Conduct a term- or year-long independent project under the advisement of the Triangle House Live-in Advisor, a faculty member, or a staff member.
Work with other residents to organize a program focused on social justice organizing, service, activism, or social change.
The Triangle House UGA and Triangle House Live-in Advisor are a few of the many people available to help you achieve your goals. They can schedule meetings with you throughout the term to offer support and guidance.
Triangle House is a substance-free community.
