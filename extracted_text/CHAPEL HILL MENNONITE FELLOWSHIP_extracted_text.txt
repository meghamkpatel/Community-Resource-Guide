Welcome
Grace and Peace to you!
Please join us for worship. We meet from 5:00-6:15 pm on Sunday evenings in the sanctuary of
Church of Reconciliation
: 110 N. Elliott Road, Chapel Hill, NC 27514.
We’re a small congregation who sustain our lives through the love of Christ offered in our relationships with one another. Our church is a place of fellowship with God and neighbors, where we learn how to serve our friends, strangers, and enemies just as Jesus laid down his life for the world.
We are members of
Central District Conference
of
Mennonite Church USA
,
NC Council of Churches
, a statewide ecumenical organization promoting Christian unity and working towards a more just society, and
Supportive Communities Network
, a network of Mennonite and Church of the Brethren communities that welcome and affirm the full participation and leadership of
LGBTQIA+
people.
We’re so excited to welcome Ben Rudeen Kreider as our new pastor! Find out a little bit more about Ben
