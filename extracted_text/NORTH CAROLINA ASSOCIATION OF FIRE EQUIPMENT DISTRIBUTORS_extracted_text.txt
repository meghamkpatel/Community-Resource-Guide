Who are We?
In 2011 a group of fire equipment company owners saw the need for North Carolina to form an association to increase the level of professionalism within our industry.  This need was recognized as many of North Carolina’s contiguous states already have such an organization.  The mission of NCAFED was birthed to provide an organization in which there would be a united voice to provide input to the North Carolina Fire Prevention Codes, an organization to provide representation for companies in North Carolina in the fire protection industry, a place to provide training and continuing education to AHJ’s and service technicians, as the fire protection industry continues to change.  On October 7, 2011 bylaws were written, approved and signed for the North Carolina Association of Fire Equipment Distributors (NCAFED).
Eddie Parrish of Parrish Fire and Safety was elected as President, Nelson Barbee of Salisbury Fire Appliance Company was elected as Vice President, Jan Laskow of Outer Banks Fire was elected as Secretary and Charles Sanford of Metro Fire and Safety was elected as Treasurer.  They all agreed to serve a three year term.  Other members elected to serve on the board were: Phil Gaines Sr. and Robert Whitley.  The work of becoming incorporated, designing a logo, establishing a website, and getting the word out about NCAFED were the first tasks to be done by this newly formed board.  We set out to find as many fire equipment service companies as we could and sent out a letter letting them know about NCAFED.  Our membership continues to grow each year.  Interested in joining? Please click the link Join NCAFED to get more information and JOIN TODAY!
We continue to hold our annual conference meetings in October of each year for both members and non-members and find out what NCAFED is about and what we are doing for our industry.  At our first annual meeting in 2014, officers and board members were elected for the next three year term.  We also have provided training classes for AHJ’s upon request and provide classes for the State Fire Marshal’s Conference each year.  We continue to look for ways in which to serve our membership.
NCAFED is working closely with the North Carolina State Fire Marshal’s office so that legislation can be presented to provide the fire protection industry in North Carolina with a licensing program that will raise our level of professionalism and provide clear guidelines for fire service technicians.
