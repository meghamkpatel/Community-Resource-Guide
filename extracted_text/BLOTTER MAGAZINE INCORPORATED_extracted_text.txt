Some nitwit says theres about a million words in it, but surely some of those are archaic, and some are slang, and many, many are technical terms (and probably a whole hell of a lot are names for medicines which are created on some app designed for such a thing, and run up a flagpole by marketing types that dont give any consideration to the idea that for most of us the name of one blood thinner brand sounds perniciously like institutionalized violence, particularly without the luxury of a pronunciation guideline).
