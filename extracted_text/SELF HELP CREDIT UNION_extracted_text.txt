Ownership & Economic Opportunity for All
Self-Help Credit Union was chartered in 1983 to build a network of branches that partner with working families and communities often underserved by the financial marketplace. With over $1.7 billion in assets and serving more than 89,000 members in 37 branches – eight in Florida, 22 in North Carolina, six in South Carolina, and one in Virginia - Self-Help Credit Union is one of the fastest-growing community development financial institutions in the country. It is part of the Self-Help family of nonprofit organizations whose collective mission is to create and protect ownership and economic opportunity for all. For over 40 years, the national Center for Community Self-Help and its affiliates have provided more than $11 billion in financing to help more than 163,000 borrowers buy homes, start and grow businesses and strengthen community resources.
