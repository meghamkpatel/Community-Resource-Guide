AMERICA’S SERVICE CLUB
Empowering individual impact since 1911
You were made to make a difference. You’ve got a deep-rooted drive to give back, and you’ve made it your mission to leave the world better than you found it. You’re dedicated and determined. You’re passionate and persistent.
You’re not alone.
We’re The National Exchange Club, and we’re full of world-changers just like you. For the past 112 years, our well-established organization has been cultivating connections among like-minded individuals to make a lasting impact on the world around us. From parents to corporations and teachers to youth, teens and students, our purpose is to provide you with the people and resources you need to put your passion into practice. Whether your particular passion is one of our own—Prevention of Child Abuse, Americanism, Community Service, and Youth Programs—or something completely different, one thing is certain: you’re here to make a change, and we can’t wait to help empower you.
4 AREAS OF IMPACT. ONE IMMENSE DIFFERENCE.
Click on a topic below to learn more about our 4 Areas of Impact—and how you can make a change in your own unique way.
PREVENTION OF CHILD ABUSE
As our National Project since 1979, our work in this field includes increasing awareness of child abuse and how it can be prevented.
AMERICANISM
As one nation, under God, we work to promote pride in the U.S.A. while also celebrating our Veterans and our country’s rich heritage.
COMMUNITY SERVICE
As the lifeline of Exchange, this area of impact allows most clubs to identify opportunities within their communities and offer assistance to fill gaps in services.
YOUTH PROGRAMS
Designed to benefit and encourage America’s future philanthropists, our focus revolves around college scholarships, mentoring and guidance, and service recognition.
