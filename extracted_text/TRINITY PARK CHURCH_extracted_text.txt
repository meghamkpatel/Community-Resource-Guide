The Gospel in
Real Life
Marriage, parenting, and work are sources of joy and pain. Abortion, persecution, racism, and slavery are real problems caused by sin in the world. Because we know that God cares about these issues and our struggles, we donâ€™t shy away from talking about them at Trinity Park.
