Services & Impact
Helius is a Durham-based  entrepreneurial consulting company specializing in small businesses and  Necessity-Driven Entrepreneurs (NDEs). NDEs are individuals who are unable to  find traditional, living wage employment. These reasons can range from job  seekers being long-time veterans, single parents with limited available hours,  people with minor criminal records, or individuals from lower socio-economic  backgrounds who lack the social networks needed to find well-paying jobs. These  individuals create work for themselves through entrepreneurship.
Among the entire  entrepreneur group in the US, 15% are NDEs. These numbers are expected to  increase by another 6.6% in the coming years.   And with Durham’s recent entrepreneurial explosion there are more NDEs  than ever, many of whom will be left behind without assistance.
Helius has created a means  to arm and protect these NDEs, who fight day in and day out to support  themselves and their families. The Helius Mentorship Program will provide all  of the services that a small business warrior needs in order to create a sustainable  business that provides at least a living wage for themselves and their  employees, all at
NO COST
to the NDEs.
