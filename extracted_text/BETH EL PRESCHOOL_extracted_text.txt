About Us  →

Child centered preschool.
Our Philosophy →
Beth El Preschool is a child-centered preschool that encourages each child's sense of wonder, joyful individuality and personal achievement.
Our low teacher-student ratios and small classes encourage close friendships, caring and sharing, and a warm sense of community. Our theme-based and age-appropriate curriculum fosters a life-long love of learning. We offer half-day programs designed for children 18 months through Pre-Kindergarten.
We love visitors. To schedule a visit, please
