I just wanted to thank you again for your timely and comprehensive response to my concern regarding my daughter's issues. It was such a gift to hear a calm, knowledgeable, and kind voice during my worried moment. We followed your advice and she has been fine.
Your generosity and service to our community do not go unnoticed! We are immensely blessed to have you as our pediatrician. Please do not feel the need to take time from your busy day to respond to this message. I hope your week gracefully flows with gentleness and ease!"
In joy,
Michelle Carter
