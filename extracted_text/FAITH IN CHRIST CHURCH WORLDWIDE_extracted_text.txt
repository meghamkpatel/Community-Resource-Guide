Our Vision
For a church to flourish and grow, it needs to have a clear sense of what God has called them to do. Faith in Christ Church Worldwide is a church with a compelling vision of TRANSFORMING A GENERATION FOR JESUS CHRIST through the preaching and teaching of the word of God (Luke 4:18). To empower believer’s growth in faith, wisdom, and the knowledge of God’s Word which makes one established in righteousness, prosperous and successful in life.
To reach out to the loss through evangelism and mission outreach; to convert men and women from religion and tradition to the truth of God’s word. Our prayer is that His spirit will fully illuminate you on this heaven-bound journey in all trials and tribulations. And that your whole heart, soul, and body be preserved through your life struggles on earth, May you confidently communicate the gospel of Jesus to others bring the unsaved to the LORD.
