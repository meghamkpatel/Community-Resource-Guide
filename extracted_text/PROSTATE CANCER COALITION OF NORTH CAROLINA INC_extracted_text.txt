Welcome to the Prostate Cancer Coalition of North Carolina (PCCNC)!
​
Vision
By working together, the citizens of North Carolina will see a day when prostate cancer is no longer a threat to the families of our state.
​
Mission
The coalition focuses on three goals:
Raising awareness of prostate cancer as a major health threat to North Carolina families.
Promoting community, state, and national action to battle this disease.
Helping to unite and coordinate the efforts of all those battling prostate cancer in North Carolina.
​Please visit our
awareness page
to learn about how to understand personal risk of developing prostate cancer and to learn about various awareness raising initiatives.  Our
early detection page
can help with understanding the value of screening and new tests that might help assure high quality personalized care.  Evolving
"best practices" programs
are designed to help patients and survivors throughout their experience.  Please feel free to
contact us
if you have any questions or would like to get involved!
