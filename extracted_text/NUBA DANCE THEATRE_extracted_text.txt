It's Wrong is a powerful ballet that focuses on the Holocaust & Apartheid that plagues the fundamental human rights within the heartbeat of the human spirit.
In 1988 NUBA dance theatre premiered "It's Wrong" at the First National Black Arts Festival in Atlanta GA. NUBA was invited to participate in the USA Freedom Tour Celebration opening ceremony, Nelson & Winnie Mandela Women's Conference in the Bay Area, at the Berkeley Community Theater in 1992 and several different venues throughout the US.
