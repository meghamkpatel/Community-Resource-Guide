Welcome
السلام عليكم
Hajar is known to Muslims as the slave-mother of  Ismael, the son of Abraham, and thus the ancestor of Muhammad. (PbuH). Muslims walk in her footsteps when performing the rites of Hajj, and recall the fact that Allah heard the cries of this single mother when she was alone in the desert, and rewarded her with the timeless gift of a blessed wellspring, which she named Zam Zam.
Hajar's well
became the locus around which the city of Mecca sprung up out of the wilderness, and to us, it
represents a source of wholesome community
. Jewish traditions tell us that Hajar was a Pharaonic Princess, who chose
slavery in Sarah’s house in preference
over her status as a Princess
in the house of Pharoah. After witnessing the miracle which Allah performed for the sake of Sarah, to save her from the hands of the Egyptian king during Abraham's visit there, she said
"It is better to be a slave in Sarah's house than a princess in my own."
In Christianity, the book of Genesis tells of her suffering the jealously of Sarah, and that two Angels of God appear to her in her lifetime, bringing tidings of Allah’s comfort and reward.

Our charity
was
founded upon the aim to provide immediate temporary assistance as well as opportunities for longer term stability to otherwise vulnerable members of the community. Over the years we have witnessed that despite our meager resources,  we are frequently able to complement the support our beneficiaries receive from  some larger organizations in our locality. As such we continue to offer two Community  Care programs even while addressing some of the other broad goals in our founding articles for the foreseeable  future. In particular, we hope to use this website further cross-cultural and inter-faith understanding and promote diversity.

Thank you for your interest in our charity, as you will note from our introduction, we're expanding the focus of our work.  We are very grateful for the opportunity we've  had to touch the lives of the women and families that we were able to support in some small way, and remain ready to act as a conduit for any who would like to help our current or future beneficiaries .  At the same time, we are acknowledging that other neighborhood organizations such as the Zakat Foundation and the Jamaat Ibad Ar Rahmaan Masjid, are currently somewhat better placed to be able to provide assistance to those in need. As you can see from our Annual Report linked below in bold green text, Hajar's Well provides a humble but
valuable complement
to these community resources. We'd  especially like to thank our donors over the years, who have made our work possible.  May Allah reward you with piety, the best reward.  We would like also to draw your attention to the springboards for cross-cultural competency vis a vis Islam, that we offer in
Peace.
