Strait Gate Greenhouses is a family oriented retail greenhouse operation located in the quiet countryside of northwest Ohio. We offer a premium selection of annuals, perennials, vegetable plants, trees, and shrubs as well as a large selection of mums and other fall items. Most of what we sell, we grow ourselves, starting our first seeds early February. If you’re in need of a break from the rat race of society, take an afternoon off and stop out for a visit. We try to keep life in the slow lane!
