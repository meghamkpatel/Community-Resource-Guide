SUPPORT FUND FOR THE TRIANGLE
Fund for the Triangle
provides direct support for the Foundation’s interconnected
impact areas
, ensuring we are able to partner with strong nonprofits that are the cornerstone of our community’s health. This permanent community-based fund allows us the flexibility to be nimble so we are able to respond quickly to pressing needs now and for generations to come. To understand how we can mobilize Fund for the Triangle, we encourage you to read more about how we did so with our
COVID-19 Recovery efforts
.
Last year, we granted nearly $1.7M through Fund for the Triangle to more than 100 strong nonprofits working across our impact areas!
Join us and be a catalyst for change!
