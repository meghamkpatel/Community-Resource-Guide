Raleigh Area Country Club Swim League Championship Back at TAC
Raleigh Area Country Club Swim League Championship Back at TAC
After a two-year COVID hiatus, the Raleigh Area Country Club Swim League (RACCSL) Championship returns to TAC this Sunday, July 26th. Nearly 450 area swimmers will be at TAC to swim in this three session event. The RACCSL Championship is the first of four summer league championships TAC will host this 2022 summer season.
This event is open to Spectators. No one is permitted to bring in deck chairs to the Spectator Stadium but may do so in the Atrium as long as they do not block any entrance or exit. We ask that the front and side parking lots be reserved for our TAC regular patrons and staff and ask those here for the event park in the new West Parking Lot or at the former Cary Towne Center.
We welcome RACSSL back to the building and are excited to  host this fun summer event. Good luck to all swimmers!
