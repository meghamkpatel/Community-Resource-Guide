VISION
UPLIFT Chatham is committed to creating a community where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.
By partnering with other organizations to deliver an evidence-based, integrated service delivery model that bundles and sequences key services (income supports, education/career, financial), we can improve self-sufficiency outcomes by three to four times.
History
In 2013, UPLIFT Chatham began offering a curriculum-based program in Pittsboro with half of the participants from the Siler City area. It aimed to empower those living in poverty to reach their goals and obtain financial self-sufficiency.

UPLIFT Chatham Offers Community Poverty Awareness Day
UPLIFT Chatham Collaborates with Partners to Begin Pilot in 2020
Poverty Awareness Day
UPLIFT Chatham delivers poverty awareness workshops throughout the year to various organizations for a fee.  UPLIFT also periodically offers a community Poverty Awareness Day open to all for a small suggested donation.
The workshops consist of two inspiring parts:
Perspectives on Poverty
invites you to a conversation on the scope of poverty in Chatham County and how individuals and organizations can work together to help financially vulnerable people become self-sufficient.
The
Cost of Poverty Experience
(COPE) is an immersive role-play learning experience that gives participants an opportunity to experience poverty firsthand through the eyes of the real people who have lived life facing its challenges.
The next community Poverty Awareness Day is not yet scheduled.  If you’re interesting in participating, please click below and we will notify you when a date is set.
