- About 4SG
The Fourth Sector Group (4SG)
is a global multi-stakeholder platform for collective leadership and action aimed at accelerating the development of a
supportive ecosystem
for the
fourth sector
.
Through a variety of collaborative initiatives, 4SG brings together businesses, civil society, governments, multilaterals, philanthropists, academia, ecosystem builders, and industry and sector leaders to
create a conducive environment for
for-benefit
organizations to thrive
.
​
- Why
Many of the social, environmental, and economic challenges we face today are downstream consequences of outmoded economic systems and organizational models whose roots date back to the industrial age. The scale, urgency, and complexity of these challenges demand a fundamental upgrade to business-as-usual.
The growing sector of
for-benefit enterprises
offers an opportunity to solve many of these challenges, while advancing inclusive and sustainable growth.
Combining attributes of traditional for-profit businesses and NGOs, for-benefit enterprises are hybrid business structures whose primary purpose is delivering social and environmental benefit. They constitute a
fourth sector
of the economy which has been growing at the intersection of the traditional private, public, and nonprofit sectors for decades.
​
​
"A surge of 'for-benefit' companies at the intersection of the traditional private, public and non-profit sectors will be critical in delivering on the SDGs by 2030.”
​
- The World Economic Forum
​
"We need leadership across multiple disciplines to develop new structures that support for-benefit entrepreneurs and investors who are leveraging business to tackle social and environmental problems."
- Sir Richard Branson,
Founder, Virgin Group

B4B Coalition
The Buy For-Benefit Coalition, which aims to leverage the trillion spent in procurement dollars to transform global value chains and advance an economy that benefits all stakeholders, launched at the World Economic Forum 2020 Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland.​
The rules for business are changing rapidly. Leading any organization today is more complex and uncertain than ever. Corporate managers are increasingly asked to do more than deliver financial results or quality goods and services; they are being tasked with tackling massive environmental and societal challenges, operationalizing purpose, and meeting the demands of multiple stakeholders, while navigating an environment of rapid change.

Fourth Sector 2030
FS 2030 aims to accelerate the development of an enabling ecosystem for purpose-driven, for-benefit businesses — the emerging fourth sector of the economy.
In collaboration with a range of partners, and with support from the UK Department for International Development (DFID), we are engaging stakeholders from the private sector, governments, inter-governmental organizations, communities, academia, civil society, philanthropy, and the fourth sector to establish a growing reservoir of knowledge, tools, and approaches for releasing the potential of for-benefit enterprise to deliver solutions across the entire range of SDGs.
