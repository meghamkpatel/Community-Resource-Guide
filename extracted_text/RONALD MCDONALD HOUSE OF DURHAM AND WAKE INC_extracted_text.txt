In 2021, The Galloway family was living near New Orleans temporarily for the husband’s job. One day, their son Gus was playing in the water outside near their home. A few days later, he was fighting a rare bacterial infection. They requested a transfer back to North Carolina to have Gus undergo cord blood transplants.

House Heroes are premier partners in our mission to support seriously ill children and their families. Many House Heroes choose to make both financial and volunteer commitments to have the greatest impact on families facing childhood illness.

Duke Children’s Hospital is the first hospital in NC to partner with RMHC. Our collaboration has offered hospitality to tens of thousands of families of sick children since 1980. Duke employees and students are also a significant volunteer force for RMHC Triangle.
Established in 1980, The Leon Levine Foundation supports programs and organizations that improve the human condition through investments in education, healthcare, human services, and Jewish values. TLLF grants have supported operations of our Chapel Hill House and the families served by UNC Children’s Hospital.
McDonald’s is the founding corporate partner of RMHC and remains our most loyal corporate donor. Through in-store sales, special promotions, employee time, and in-kind donations of food and supplies, McDonald’s serves up love for our chapter each and every day.
In 2018, the Mead Family Foundation began granting funds to RMHC Triangle to make healthy food available at the Durham House. Our “Grab and Go” partnership makes healthy snacks and meals available to busy parents both at the House and at the hospital.
WakeMed Children's Hospital is our first hospital partner in Raleigh, offering both residential rooms for family overnight stays as well as in-hospital respite for caregivers through the Ronald McDonald Family Room on the pediatric floor. WakeMed is a long-time supporter of RMHC Triangle events.
