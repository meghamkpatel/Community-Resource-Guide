industry back-to-work guidelines
We’ve researched extensively on the steps necessary to ensure your set is safe and green, so that we can become your turnkey solution. Our approach integrates the protocols from the following return to work guidelines:
The Safe Way Forward
PGA’s Covid Safety Protocols
Green Production Guide
a green recovery
Rarely in an industry’s history are we presented with the opportunity to rewrite the rules. This time, let’s put set safety and sustainability first.
Animal-related disease outbreaks like COVID-19 are occurring more frequently (
UNEP
) as a result of the climate crisis and human destruction of natural habitats (
IPBES
). To protect ourselves and prevent future pandemics, we must prevent destruction of nature and re-establish industry standards with a “green recovery.”
