Resident Engagement
Our residents help drive our progress, planning and growth.
Resident Participation and Governance
Our 35-year history has shown us that resident-driven engagement results in improved lives, greater equity, new or strengthened campus programs, new standards or expectations for life in the community and improved quality of life for all.
Today, our residents – over 800 strong – take an active role in our governance through our non-profit Residents’ Association and our volunteer, community-based Board of Directors.
The Residents’ Association
Our 23 committees deal with all aspects of campus life, and five of them are advisory to the Carolina Meadows administration:
Budget and Finance
Building and Grounds
Dining Services
Health and Wellness
Marketing and Public Relations
“The commitment to allowing residents to be so involved is unique. I feel as though the community is just so generous in its ability to allow people to participate.”
