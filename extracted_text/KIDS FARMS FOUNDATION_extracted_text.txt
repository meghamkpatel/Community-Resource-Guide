About The Farm
Spring Brook Farm, home of Farms for City Kids,  is a traditional dairy farm located in Reading, Vermont. It spans more than 1,000 acres and is home to a wide array of livestock—the maintenance and care of which keep our Farms for City Kids students quite busy. Our Farm is home to over 100 registered Jerseys, and the 42 milking cows produce over 600,000 lbs. of milk each year.  This milk is used by Spring Brook Farm Cheese, LLC to make their award-winning artisanal cheeses. The Farm is also home to a Sugar Bush with more than 3000 taps, that produces Maple Syrup & Maple Cream. The proceeds of which support the Farms for City Kids Program.  The Farm is part of the Vermont Land Trust conservation program, and has been providing programming at no cost to the visiting schools for more than 25 years.
