Bridge II Sports creates opportunities for youth, adults, and Veterans with physical disabilities through the power of adapted sports.
We believe sport empowers and changes lives on and off the court and challenges perceptions of disability in our community.
We are proud to provide
year-round adapted sports programming
and special events like
Valor Games Southeast
that bring together our athletes and the community.
We recognize the value and potential of all lives.
Disability does not define people or outcomes.
Find out what is at the heart of adapted sports from a range of Bridge II Sports athletes. Hear their advice for people with disabilities who are sitting on the sideline.
Thank you to Allen Owens, spring 2022 Occupational Therapy student intern from Mary Baldwin University, who completed this video as part of his Doctoral Capstone Experience. (
