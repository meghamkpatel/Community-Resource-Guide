Our Rare + Undiagnosed Disease Story
The
Luka The Lion Foundation
honors Luka Fisher, born March 4, 2014 also known as "March Forth," who fought bravely like a lion his entire life. With a rare disease that is thought to be unique to him after extensive diagnostic testing, Luka endured a lifetime of medical treatment to earn a total of 48 feel of Beads of Courage. On this necklace, each bead represents every day and procedure of his 10 hospitalizations and frequent clinic visits. Luka did this all while teaching us to embody the characteristics of a lion of beauty, bravery, strength, and resilience -- and to always remember to roar. Despite his passing away at nearly 21 months on December 1, 2015 and #GivingTuesday, Luka continues to guide us as we give support to kids like him who brave rare disease and their care-giving families.
Why We Serve | How We Roar
1 in 10 people in the U.S. have a rare disease, that's 30 million people. 80% of people who brave rare disease are kids, that's 24 million kids. Of the 7,000 known rare diseases, only 15% of these diseases have a foundation that provides support. That's an estimated 20 million kids who don't have access to a Foundation that directly supports their disease. Luka and his older brother Maks, now both angels, were two of these kids. The Fishers are that family who braved rare disease and didn't have a Foundation offering direct support. Yet, they aren't the only ones. That's why the Luka The Lion Foundation supports kids with rare diseases and their families so nobody ever feels alone -- no matter the diagnosis, or lack of diagnosis ("undiagnosed"). We address patient and family's unique needs. Without the Luka The Lion Foundation's supporters, affectionately known as The Pride, kids with rare disease and their families wouldn't have access to resources they need.
