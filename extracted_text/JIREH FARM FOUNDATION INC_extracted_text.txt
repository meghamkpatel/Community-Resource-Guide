It all began with eggs.  As an early teen, Makayla purchased a small flock of chickens and invested in an egg business to purchase her first car. Within three years, she earned enough to buy that car.  Today, the family has incorporated that small investment into seasonal quantities of multi-colored eggs from the farm

About the Jarvis
Family
In 2020, Jireh Family Farm chose to purchase a Black Angus steer, partner with other families, and to enjoy natural, non-hormone beef.  It was so amazing they did it again.  Now, the farm offers premium beef cuts for your family.

In early 2017, our family took a big step on the farm.  We purchased two baby piglets.  It only took seven months for them to exceed 400 pounds!  We processed them through a USDA plant, kept some pork and sold the rest to family and friends.  We loved the meat so much, we did it again.  Today, you can enjoy some of our natural, farm-raised pork sold by the cut.

Injured piglet results in family-style pig pickin’ at Jireh Family Farm
Jireh Family Farm does a first-time homestead butchering of a baby pig that was injured by his mother. .The Jarvis family participated in humanely killing, scalding, cleaning, and smoking a young, twenty-five pound piglet.  Makayla, our 18 year old successful dispatched her first kill with a .22 rifle.  We removed the hair easily after dunking the pig (a half at a time) in nearly boiling water.  Then the Jarvis daughters helped to eviscerate the animal and were fascinated with the process.  After seasoning the meat with dry BBQ rub, we sat the pig in our electric smoker for six hours and 250 degrees.

The family offers permaculture pork, whole, grass-grained chicken, rabbit meat, goat meat, black angus beef, and free-range eggs for the nearby community. They also breed Great Pyrenees (livestock guardian dogs) to help protect the property.
