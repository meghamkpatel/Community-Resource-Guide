CAARE Food Pantry Wishlist
Your gesture of kindness,
small or large, makes a difference.
During the COVID 19 pandemic, CAARE has been challenged with an increasing need for healthy food among members of the Durham community facing financial hardship.
Once a week, anyone who shows up to CAARE, receives a box of food to take home with no questions asked.  Stricter safety regulations, decreased funding, and a drop in volunteer engagement have made it even harder for CAARE to operate with the efficiency necessary to continue meeting this need.  The items on this list will make CAARE’s food pantry more efficient, and will empower CAARE to help more people during this crisis.
If you'd like to learn more contact
hhinton@caare-inc.org
