Why Support Upper Keys Habitat for Humanity?
Safe and stable homes are the foundation of healthy families and sustainable communities. But owning a home is not possible for many of our neighbors. Together we can work toward eliminating poverty and substandard housing in the Upper Keys – Key Largo, Tavernier and Islamorada.

Become An Office Volunteer
Habitat volunteers contribute more than muscle. Creativity, strategy, and technical skills are among the many invaluable traits volunteers bring to the organization. With a minimal staff, Habitat for Humanity of the Upper Keys depends upon volunteer support to help run the operations. You don't need to be an expert in any of these fields to help out! There are many tasks that require only a willingness to learn and work with others.

Join a Committee
Due to the tremendous amount of planning and management required to build just one home, we have a constant need for volunteer committee members to facilitate the organization. Committees range from Homeowner Selection, Family Support, Land Acquisition and Construction, and more!

Become A Build Site Volunteer
Though the vast majority have no construction experience or building skills, volunteers are involved in more of the later phases of construction at HfHUK.
By working side-by-side with the family who will live in the house, our volunteers experience for themselves the joy created when a family is able to realize their dream of home ownership.
As a volunteer for Habitat for Humanity of the Upper Keys, you can choose to volunteer as little or as often as you would like. All of these positions are a tremendous help that directly or indirectly result in the construction of simple, decent homes.​
The safety of our volunteers is always a priority, our construction safety policy can be found here.
