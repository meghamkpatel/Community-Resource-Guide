The Society for Novel Studies (SNS) exists to further the study of the novel as a genre and to examine the role of fiction in engaging, formulating, and shaping the world.
Members of the SNS share an interest in the novel as a historical and contemporary phenomenon, as a genre continually open to change and experimentation, and as a national, regional, transnational, and global form. The society's membership is occupied in researching individual works of fiction and their writers and in engaging in critical study of the theoretical questions posed by the writing, reading, translation, distribution, and consumption of novels.
