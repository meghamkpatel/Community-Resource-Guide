We are
The Ark Church.
The Ark Church is located in the Research Triangle Park area of NC. We love our little big church with a heart committed to serving the families of the Triangle. The Mission of The Ark Church is simple: To foster an environment for every believer to experience God’s Presence, God’s Power, and God’s Purpose.
The Ark Church set voyage in Pastor Steve and First Lady Tara’s kitchen on January 3, 2016. At that time, 12 people began a journey to experience God’s Presence, Power and Purpose. The Ark’s mission is simple and reflects the will of God. At its core, it’s about a relationship with God through His son, Jesus Christ. We believe our relationship with Christ is a journey that progresses over time. As we know God and are known by Him, we experience not only His presence, but His power in our lives. It’s the “God-journey” that ultimately reveals God’s purpose for our lives. The Ark Church is a community of believers committed to a lifelong journey with you! At The Ark, it’s about your journey with God!
Our Vision & What We Believe
We exist to know God and to be known by Him.
There is One God: God the Father; God the Son; and God the Holy Spirit!
The Ark’s mission is simple and reflects the will of God. At its core, it’s about a

lifelong journey with you! At The Ark, it’s about your journey with God!
We are transparent in believing and knowing that only with the shed blood of
Jesus Christ, we are saved by grace. That Jesus Christ is the Risen Savior who
saved us from sin and death. That with the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, it is a gift
available to believers receiving a new birth and empowering them to be sharers
of the Gospel, accompanied with the prayer language of speaking in other
tongues
We are an “imperfect church” that wants to be the perfect church for you, an
“imperfect people” who are loved with the love of Jesus Christ.
WELCOME HOME!
God's Presence
To continually produce change and spiritual maturity.

Through the Ark Life Bible Studies, Pastor Steve delivers a powerful teaching each Wednesday night through web conferencing. It offers individuals and families with busy lives to log into a fun interactive bible study from wherever they may be. These bible studies are simple yet inspiring and are designed to help us understand and apply God’s word to our everyday life.
Pastor Steve sums it up like this, Sunday is for inspiration and Wednesday is for information. If you’re looking to experience God in a relevant and life-changing way, please join us on Sundays at 10:00 AM and Wednesdays at 6:30 PM.

How To
Request A Prayer.
The Covenant Prayer Ministry Team have committed themselves to the ministry of prayer. Each Covenant Prayer partner believes, according to 2 Chronicles 7:14, that the Lord hears the prayers of those called by his name. This ministry not only endeavors to pray without ceasing, but also to teach the methodology of prayer.
The prayer team meets before every service and corporately at 9:00 AM on Sunday mornings. Our weekly conference call on Tuesdays at 8:00 PM provides a loving and confidential atmosphere to agree in prayer. To join please call our prayer line at
712-770-4010 (Passcode: 388049).
Community Ministry
We Minister To
The Community.
The Ark Church of the Triangle is committed to the great commission found in the book of Mark 16:15. “And he said, unto them, go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believes not shall be damned.” This is best expressed in the “Road to Romans,” which is the common evangelism tool for outreach ministry. We encourage everyone to share the “Road to Romans.”
In addition to our commitment to meeting the spiritual needs of individuals, we strongly believe in providing for the physical needs of those less fortunate. To that end, we’ve established The Ark Cares program designed to partner with local and international agencies providing relief around the world. The Ark Church has ministered to local orphans, domestic violence victims, and assists with families in financial crisis, including providing access to critical medications to those in Puerto Rico suffering from respiratory diseases.
