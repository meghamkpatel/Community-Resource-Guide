Why are we running a 6k? 6 kilometers is the average distance someone in the developing world, usually women and children, walks every day to get water. We are walking and running to raise money for Speed the Light's partner - World Serve - that provides clean water, sanitation, education, and economic opportunities to alleviate suffering in Africa.
Food Pantry
Come get a free box of food at our food pantry, held here at Evangel Assembly of God every 1st and 3rd Wednesdays of the month from 4-6 PM.
You can stay in your car the whole time - the box will be loaded into your car for you! No ID or address required.
If you need food, don't hesitate to come to the food pantry!
