“Met this wonderful gentleman named JT and we went our fishing today, me for the first time in a long time. And by my third cast, I caught a bass! Couldn’t have done it without JT – professional, patient, took his time with me and I’m just telling you I feel like I’ve known him forever. He’s my new friend and I couldn’t have asked for a better experience today.”  – Katrina
