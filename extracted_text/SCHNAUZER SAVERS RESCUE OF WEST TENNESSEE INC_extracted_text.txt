Schnauzer Savers Rescue
Schnauzer Savers Rescue is a Southeastern US 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization dedicated to finding forever homes for Schnauzers and other non-shedding dogs.
We are given dogs by owners who no longer can care for their loved one. We are also notified by public authorities when they see a Schnauzer among a group of dogs needing help.
Our staff, both professional and volunteer, routinely travel throughout the Southeast to rescue wonderful, deserving-to-be-loved-in-a-permanent-home Schnauzers!

Our mission and passion is to create a safe and healthy community and environment for pets and people.  To transform their lives through our dedication of care, food, education, adoptions and our Ministries.
With our animals we aim to rehabilitate and educate the general public about the importance of spay/neuter to the reduce population of the cruel realities of the dogs breeding industry.
Our faith, dedication along with working with different Ministries in helping those in need of food, clothing, personal and household items.  Together as a Village we can accomplish this!

A Tribute to Our Founders
Schnauzer Savers Rescue was founded by Michael and Karen Rudolph as their love of animals began from an early age bringing home stray dogs. As they grew and moved through life, they met and married, Schnauzers became the breed to save and thus; Schnauzer Savers Rescue was born.
In 2003/04, Michael had been deployed to Iraq to serve our country with over 28 years of service, but unfortunately sustained serious life changing brain damage. The Rudolph’s packed up from Florida and moved to southwest Tennessee. Health issues didn’t slow Michael down and the rescue burst with dogs needing their help with them saving over 4,100 dogs. In 2011 Karen and Michael made it official with Schnauzer Savers Rescue obtaining their 501c3. In 2014 as Mike’s health declined, the need to be closer to the best medical care was urgent.
Karen and Michael Rudolph
In 2010, Dale and Angie Clarke came on board as volunteers to expand into North Carolina. The Clarke’s grew into larger roles as Mike’s health declined further. Mike passed September 2018. In January 2021 Karen retired with her own health issues.
God called on Karen and Mike to help save lives. They spent their time, energy, personal funding, and gave their lives to be the voices of the animals. We thank Karen and Mike for their love and dedication to Schnauzer Savers Rescue.
The Clarke’s, along with MANY volunteers now carry their legacy to build Schnauzer Savers Rescue. We have saved over 8500 dogs to date.
Happy Tails
Our organization exists to help dogs and humans!   Help them get healthy! Help them find a permanent, loving home.
We are delighted to share successful rescue stories.
Einstein & Pippin
Pippin & Einstein what a LoverBoys!
Pippin and Einstein were  owner surrenders.
Their  back story was a there was huge change in a family situation and the family decided it was best for us to place him and his brother Einstein in a loving home together.
All the way from Oklahoma to NC we had them vetted and hand transported to us and they had a wonderful, loving retired Military family awaiting their arrival.  This family has waited months for the right dog to come along and decided to keep these two together.  So they adopted them both.   We get updates of how they’re doing.  Adjust well, living a life of pure joy, love and most of all to help their original owners know how well they are cared for now.
Special Sarge
Our Special Sarge!
This guy came to us about 7 yrs ago, he was adopted by a family.  They came to us about 2 yrs ago saying they may return him as her husband had suffered a stroke and wasn’t sure she could care for both.  Over a few days they decided he loved the husband so much she wasn’t able to part with him.
Fast forward to 2023, I get a call in May he has been surrendered to a shelter in another state.  Furious was an understatement since our contracts state you must return a dog to us if you can no longer care for it or even want it.  So the wife takes the dog to another state and just dumps an 11 yr old dog like he was garbage.  We had a wonderful lady in that state who had lost her own Schnauzer and SHE ONCE HAD A RESCUE, she immediately jumped to say I WILL ADOPT HIM NOW.  Kathy drove over 3 hours to get him and well the rest is history.  He is now groomed, healthy and so loved and living the best life.
TO GOD BE THE GLORY
