Spread the Love Foundation (STLF)
is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded by internationally acclaimed Bone Thugs-N-Harmony member Anthony “Krayzie Bone” Henderson. Located in Cleveland, OH, STLF advocates for urban arts cultural equity by providing music industry education and workforce development for disadvantaged populations to improve Cleveland communities. STLF advocates for urban arts and culture education as well as workforce development for minorities in Glenville and Hough.  Krayzie Bone’s vision is to spark career interests by providing a launchpad for artists and professionals into the music industry from right here in Cleveland. STLF’s goal is for Cleveland Municipal School District (CMSD) students to gain insight on the various career paths within urban arts and entertainment, while young adults will be offered internships to learn the inner workings of the music business and acquire real-world portfolio projects and experience.
Spread the Love Foundation is commissioned by Krayzie Bone to fundraise to erect the Bone Thugs-N-Harmony Urban Arts Academy & Ohio Hip-Hop Museum in Glenville. The urban arts academy will be a paid internship certificate program where ages 18-26 will sharpen their skills and talents by learning from entertainment industry professionals. The academy will offer four (4) curriculum tracks that students can chose to complete one or all four tracks. The academy itself will be a museum dedicated to Ohio’s contribution to the hip-hop culture and entertainment alike. The academy will also offer programming for Cleveland Municipal School District students to supplement arts education and career guidance into the arts. Additionally, STLF advocacy also includes petitioning for Hip-Hop culture to be recognized and installed as a part of the Cleveland Cultural Gardens.
