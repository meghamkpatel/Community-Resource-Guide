Terrific operation. We've purchased two sofas, a bed and a desk; all were represented very thoughtfully. In each case, the sa
les team took time to understand where & how the furnishings would be used, and proposed solutions that would best suit our needs (and our budget). And the delivery team of Jermain & Michael did their job flawlessly. 100% recommend.

I ended up buying two Flexsteel sofas after emailing pictures of my carpet, they sent me back the dimensions of the sofas and
then helped me pick out fabric that was durable and pet friendly. I’m excited to get my sofas since it has taken me a year to find something I like.

We were looking for couple of sofas and couple of armchairs, in a mid range price but built to last. We checked several store

We had a really great experience at North Carolina furniture. Wes took great care of us. There are so many decisions to make
when you order a couch, more than I ever thought. Wes always brought up pros and cons, she is very friendly and patient. I would recommend this business . We also ordered a dining riom table that we could design ourselves , width, height, leaves and color. We got the table we have been looking for but couldn’t find . That was a very easy decision to make. Overall, everyone that works there are so friendly and helpful! Super customer service!
