WELCOME TO VFW AUX NC
Unwavering Support for Uncommon Heroes
Welcome to the North Carolina Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States. We are an organization consisting of fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers sons, daughters, grandfathers, grandmothers, grandsons, and granddaughters of those persons, both male, and female that have honorably served in the Armed forces of the United States. We believe in Americanism, which has been defined as a unfailing love of country; loyalty to its institutions and ideals; eagerness to defend it against all enemies; undivided allegiance to the flag; and a desire to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and posterity.
We serve and support the veterans, active duty soldiers, and their families of the United States. For, they are the ones that put their lives on the line to allow us the daily freedoms we enjoy.

WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING
Inspirational testimonials and quotes
President Kennedy said once "Ask not what your country can do for you, 
but what you can do for your country." There are few ways less noble to 
serve our country than through the military. The courage and strength 
that you all exude are qualities which deserve only our highest 
gratitude. I cannot thank you enough for what you have done.
"Patriotism is not short, frenzied outbursts of emotion, but the tranquil
 and steady dedication of a lifetime." I agree wholeheartedly that it is
 the dedication of a lifetime that defines true patriotism.
Brandon Dale
You all have given
 not only your time, dedication and effort, butâmost importantlyâyour 
very being to the protection and advancement of this great country. You 
work tirelessly for the rights of the veterans who serve our country, 
while conducting the nationâs finest civic training to instill young 
future leaders with the knowledge, understanding and wisdom to govern 
this country.
