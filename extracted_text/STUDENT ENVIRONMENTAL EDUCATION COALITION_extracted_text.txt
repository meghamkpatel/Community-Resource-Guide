SEEC
SEEC has moved! Visit our new home at
https://www.ncseec.org
Welcome to the blog for the Student Environmental Education Coalition (SEEC)!
Lauded by luminaries like the Governor of North Carolina and the former U.S. Secretary of Education, SEEC has grown to become the leading hub of grassroots environmental education in North Carolina. Through innovative nonprofit programs and partnerships, SEEC engages with key environmental issues and inspires young people to take action for a cleaner world, for all.
SEEC’s primary focus for 2018 is
advocacy —
we have partnered with national organizations like the Sierra Club and Dogwood Alliance to bring about grassroots change together! SEEC has had a very busy year, and with many more events on our calendar, here are just a few of our highlights:
Storytelling with Dogwood Alliance:
On July 27th, people from all over North Carolina came together to share a night of storytelling and environmental dialogue. The night featured 10 awe-inspiring stories that spoke to the core of what protecting our environment is all about. SEEC and Dogwood hope to continue our partnership to organize future events in the Triangle community!
Governor Cooper Call-in Day:
Enviva, a corporation that manages wood pellet factories to provide an alternative fuel source, is building a wood pellet factory in Richmond County that will result in mass deforestation and lasting environmental health consequences in the community. This would be disastrous for the environment, which is why we’re holding a call-in day to request Governor Cooper to revoke Enviva’s permit for their factory. Want to learn more? Watch this video:

Sierra Club:
SEEC is excited to begin a new partnership with Sierra Club, an international nonprofit famous for protecting our environment! SEEC and Sierra Club plan on getting heavily involved in activism in the local community. For example, we are getting involved in protests against Duke Energy raising electricity rates by 15% to pay for their coal ash spill, when Duke should be taking responsibility for their own actions and paying for it themselves.
Stay tuned for more details and updates!

Governor Cooper Call-in Day
November 20, 2017
December 23, 2017
SEEC
Enviva, a corporation that manages wood pellet factories to provide a supplementary fuel source for European countries, is building a wood pellet factory in Richmond County that will result in mass deforestation and lasting environmental health consequences for the already-disadvantaged community. In a coordinated effort to combat this injustice, SEEC recently hosted a call-in event at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics. Hundreds of students called the offices of Governor Roy Cooper to encourage him to revoke Enviva’s permit to build their factory, and SEEC hopes to continue fighting this issue in the coming months. Watch the video to learn more!

SEEC Field Day
September 21, 2017
October 24, 2017
SEEC
SEEC’s first Field Day was an afternoon filled with excitement as students at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics learned about different ways to promote environmental literacy and action! Through trivia competitions, recycling games, raffles (with prizes including succulents and solar-powered USB kits), and other entertaining activities, over 100 gifted students learned more about both environmental problems and solutions. This event demonstrably achieved our goal of informing future leaders about environmental stewardship, while engaging students in an interesting and light-hearted afternoon. Many more high school students are now involved with SEEC!

SEEC has gone abroad!
June 22, 2017
September 12, 2017
SEEC
For the last week, past Executive Director Kenneth Xu has been visiting public schools in Eastern China and talking to teachers, administrators, and government officials about the importance of environmental education. Through discussions with local educators and interactive lectures for K-12 students (conducted entirely in Mandarin), SEEC has been promoting environmental literacy on a truly global scale this summer. We look forward to continuing this journey as SEEC constantly expands, though we’ll be back in North Carolina for our NatureWay Summer Camp in August!

Colloquium Series: Jedediah Purdy, Environmental Law Expert
December 18, 2016
December 18, 2016
SEEC
In January of 2017, Jedediah Purdy will visit the
North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics
to discuss environmental ethics, law, and politics! Although this talk is open to all students, registration will be on a first-come-first-serve basis. Stay on the lookout for more details on how to sign up to meet one of America’s most fascinating intellectuals!
“Jedediah Purdy is a law professor at Duke University and the author of several popular books on American culture and history. His first book, ‘For Common Things: Irony, Trust, and Commitment in America Today,’ was published in 1999, when Purdy was a 24 year old law student at Yale University, and made him something of an intellectual and political celebrity. Purdy, who is known for his earnest demeanor and unabashed concern for things that matter, described the book as ‘one young man’s letter of love for the world’s possibilities.’ Purdy’s parents were self-described hippies seeking an honest, simple, rural life when they moved from Pennsylvania to a farm in West Virginia shortly before he was born…Purdy was homeschooled until age 13, eventually making his way to Exeter and then Harvard University, before completing his law degree at Yale. A ‘wildly popular’ teacher at Duke, Purdy recently finished a book on the nature and origins of private property.”
