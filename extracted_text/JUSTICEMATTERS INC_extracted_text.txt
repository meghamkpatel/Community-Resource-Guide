Protecting children, helping survivors rebuild their lives
Join the Cause
Human trafficking is the exploitation of vulnerability for profit. Founded in 2009, JusticeMatters is a nonprofit law firm that addresses the roots (causes) and repercussions (impacts) of human trafficking. We help our clients overcome legal barriers to safety, stability, and services, which are foundational to wellbeing. Centering client voices, we advocate for systems change to prevent human trafficking from happening in the first place.

Our Impact: 14 Years Strong!
Over the past year, JusticeMatters
responded to
calls
requesting legal assistance
and served a record
clients.
Some of our clients have survived human trafficking. Many more are at heightened risk of exploitation due to lack of legal status in the United States, lack of legal security in a family, or prior experience of trauma.
We protect the rights of our clients and provide high-quality, trauma-informed family law and immigration services, reducing the risk of exploitation and helping survivors rebuild their lives.
In the last 5 years alone we’ve served over 2,500 clients, both survivors and those at heightened risk of exploitation. Our team and budget have tripled, and we’re still growing to meet the need. We envision the freedom and flourishing of all.
