"Education is the most powerful weapon
which you can use to change the world"
Fundo Scholars Foundation Inc was founded on the philosophy of giving back to those in need, giving hope and connecting children to opportunities. We exist to help children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Currently, we are removing impediments to education by providing academic resources such as text books, internet access, laptops, Lantern Battery Powered Lights used to study at night, pay for school fees, uniforms, textbooks, transportation fees and food to children in Zimbabwe.

We have partnered with Tanaka Designs, a high end sock brand, which specializes in designing and selling custom, colorful printed, premium Egyptian cotton socks and with each sock sold a portion of goes to supporting a child in Zimbabwe, ensuring they get to go to school on a full stomach.

Quality Education
Access to quality education which provides children with the knowledge and life skills they need to realize their full potential. It’s also essential to creating change in a child’s life and breaking down barriers that prevent many children and girls in particular from attending school and staying in school.
Every child deserves a healthy start
Access to health is essential. Fundo Scholars helps communities get access to medical attention. We also teach and provided resources to a healthy lifestyle by teaching and following God’s 8 laws of health so children can grow up healthy and strong.

Water & sanitation
Water and sanitation are also essential for every child’s survival. Fundo Scholars helps communities with community water access points to get fresh clean borehole water.
Economic Security
Economic security: means people have the skills and resilience they need to withstand hard economic times and grow their incomes. Fundo Scholars works to overcome poverty by helping communities in Zimbabwe gain the economic security they need to thrive; this includes training people living in poverty to acquire the skills and knowledge they need to secure a livelihood and support their families.
“I realize that school can help me achieve my goals and improve my life.”
