COACH'S Philosophy
​
The goal is to teach athletes the fundamentals while also working on the mental side of the game. Having athletes on the team that are willing to work hard and be consistent is important.
Hustle
- players are to jog/run to positions, stations, etc. once they set out of the dugout or onto the field. There is no excuse not to hustle.
​
Communication
- every players is expected to talk on the field, cheer on their teammates in the dugout, etc. There is no excuse not to communicate.
​
Work hard
- players are asked to give it everything they have when at practice or games. There is no excuse to not working hard.
​
Have fun
- players will only be given a short amount of time to play the game of softball. It doesn't last a lifetime. There is no excuse to not have fun.
These are the 4 areas that each player can control. No one can take this away from them, make them stop, etc. Each player will be asked to commit to these 4 pillars of play while competing to their full potential. No excuses.
Sometimes the only fair thing in life is
a ball hit between 1st and 3rd
