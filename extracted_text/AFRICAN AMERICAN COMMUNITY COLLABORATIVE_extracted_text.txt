2022 Juneteenth Gala
The Afro-American Collaborative Community held our First Annual Juneteenth Black Tie Gala celebrating the community's culture and unity. This event created an environment where everyone was able to network with each other, honor our community's achievements, and have time to be proud of our history, culture, and heritage. 275 people joined us for a night of excellent food, dancing, and entertainment.
Our Keynote speaker was Dr. Julius Wayne Dudley, professor emeritus of history at Salem State University. Dr. Dudley has played a pivotal role as a civil rights activist and educator throughout his lifetime. From marching alongside Martin Luther King, Jr. and Congressman Joe Lewis in the 1960s to working with Archbishop Desmond Tutu in post-apartheid South Africa, Dr. Dudley has devoted himself to serving others.
Recognizing his tireless work, we honored Dr. Dudley with the Afro-American Community Collaborative Perfecting Unity Award.
2022 Juneteenth & Fatherâs Day Block Party
In the spirit of community celebration and national recognition, The Afro-American Community Collaborative was excited to announce our 3rd Annual Juneteenth & Father's Day Block Party.

Our vision was to create a welcoming space for all with 300+ guests. With Free food and snacks for all
This year, the Afro-American Community Collaborative collaborated with community leaders and organizations from the Merrimack Valley to help create a culturally transformative event.
Flag Football Clinic
Afro-American Community Collaborative, Lowell Police Youth Services Program, and Merrimack Valley Flag Football collaborated on a free flag football clinic for Lowell youth.
Students at the clinic got to meet and talk to former Lowell High School football star John Blake Galvin, who went on to play for Boston College and then the Jets and Vikings in the NFL, and Leon Powe, a former power forward for the Boston Celtics who shared in the teamâs 2008 championship. Lowell High School Football Coach Shyheim Cullen also attended and spoke to the students.
Approximately 60 Lowell youth in grades 5 to 8 participated in the clinic from Aug. 16-18 at Cawley Stadium, with T-shirts, flags, water, snacks, and even a post-clinic BBQ provided.
