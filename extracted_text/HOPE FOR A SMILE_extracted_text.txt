Restoring hope and transforming
lives
through dental care.
Join us as we provide dental care in underserved communities by developing leaders and cultivating collaborative partnerships.
Donate
We
restore
hope to patients and
equip
dental professionals to be leaders in their communities.
Countless people in our own community and in developing countries don’t have access to quality dental care — leading to loss of sleep, inability to work, and more serious health concerns. We train and develop dental professionals who provide emergent and restorative dental care that serves people who cannot access or afford high-quality dental services.
Our Model
What We Do
Mobile
Outreaches
We establish relationships in unreached areas and provide urgent dental care to those in need.
Dental
Clinics
We empower local leaders to establish clinics that provide ongoing, high-quality restorative care.
Leadership
Development
We identify, train, and send out individuals who are interested in the dental profession.
Our Local Mission
Hope Smiles not only has a global mission, but a local mission right here in Tennessee that you can be a part of. We have neighbors throughout our state who either can’t afford or simply can’t find the dental care they need, and we have events throughout the year to serve as many people as possible.

Faces of Hope Smiles
MARTIN
He told us he had not slept for three days and thought he was dying. A friend told him to go to Hope Smiles because the local medical doctors could not help him.
Martin is a local schoolteacher and thought he was going to lose his job. The Hope Smiles team educated him about his problems and provided the proper care to relieve his pain…and maintain his smile!
Now Martin smiles brighter than ever, and he shares that smile with his students everyday.
MARY
“Without Hope Smiles, I would be very sad. I used to avoid spending time with people because I didn’t want them to see my teeth. I’m a happy person, but I was afraid to smile. Now I can be myself again and smile freely! My smile brings joy to my heart. It also lets me encourage other people to care for their teeth too.”
