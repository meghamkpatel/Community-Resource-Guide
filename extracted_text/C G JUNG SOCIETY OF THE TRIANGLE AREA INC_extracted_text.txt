About Us
We are an organization of people interested in the work of Swiss psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung and his followers.
​​We are inspired by and deeply engaged in the evolution of Jung's paradigm of analytical psychology.
​​We nurture the search for meaning, ​nourish the psyche, ​awaken imagination, and ​support the healing journey.
​​We do this through lectures, workshops, small groups, salons, experiential encounters, retreats, and social events.
​
People with a wide range of interests and professions attend our events. ​Non-members are welcomed at all lectures and workshops.
