Welcome to
Jubilee Home
Collaborating with justice involved folk to foster belonging, promote healing, and build wellness into our community through quality, low barrier, supportive housing.
Jubilee Home works with folks in the Durham community to create a place that bridges the gap between incarceration and full independence.
Our goals as an organization balance the real social and psychological needs of residents with an understanding of community that comes from our belief that everyone has something to contribute.
