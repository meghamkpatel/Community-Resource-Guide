“Choosing Family Preschool is one of the best decisions we’ve made as parents. Our son loves FPS because of his friends, amazing teachers and the best playground in town. We love it because our son is thriving and the parent run co-op model allows us to really get to know the teachers and families, and trust that our son is in the best hands. Helping in the classroom and seeing our son play and interact with his friends is the best part of my month and something I will miss tremendously when our time at family preschool is done.”
