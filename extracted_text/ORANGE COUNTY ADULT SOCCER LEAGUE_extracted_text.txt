Welcome OCASL!
WELCOME TO OCASL @TASL!!!
It is with great excitement that OCASL (Orange County Adult Soccer League) and TASL (Triangle Adult Soccer League) have partnered to create OCASL @TASL!
Rob Smith, Founder and Director of OCASL, is stepping away to devote more time to the OCASL Foundation. Through efforts and approval of the Boards of both organizations, OCASL @TASL will continue to operate independently for the OCASL and DCASL (Durham County Adult Soccer League) members and the Orange and Durham County soccer communities. TASL welcomes OCASL into the growing family of adults playing soccer in the triangle area!
We look forward to supporting the beautiful community of adults playing soccer in Orange and Durham counties.
If you have any questions, please email
ocasl@tasl.us
and Jeannie and Donna will be glad to assist!  Phone 919-341-4554
