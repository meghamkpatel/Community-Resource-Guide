Welcome to compassion waco
Transitional Housing for Homeless 
Families, located in Waco, Texas
Overwhelmed by the daily needs of the homeless, several local pastors and leaders began meeting in Fall 1993 to discuss the realities, dilemmas, and needs of these members of our community.
Out of those meetings came a conviction that creating an organization focusing specifically on the homeless and their needs was critical.
Compassion Ministries was incorporated in May 1994, and a 20-member 
board of directors was established.
