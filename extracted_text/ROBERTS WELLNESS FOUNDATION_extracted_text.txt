Measuring Our Progress
We are learning from cutting-edge research and community wisdom about whether our work is making a difference.
What We've Learned
We Inform Policies
We support new bodies of evidence that deepen and shift our understanding of health and wellbeing. The data and evidence help us identify and promote policies that challenge our institutions to be more equitable and effective for all of us.
OUR EVIDENCE
A Healthier, More Equitable New Jersey
In our own backyard, there is a lot to be proud of when it comes to health—but there also are wide, persistent gaps in health across the state of New Jersey. We redouble our commitment to improving health and advancing health equity for all in New Jersey and beyond.
