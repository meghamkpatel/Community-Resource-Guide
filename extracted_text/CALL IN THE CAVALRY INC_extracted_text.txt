Call in the Cavalry- Veterans in Mexico

The Veteran nonprofit space is quite a crowded one lately, and there are many great projects I have been involved with after my service. But this organization was one of the best experiences in my life, and I can't wait to share why!
Call in the Cavalry
is a veteran run nonprofit organization that focuses on helping military veterans through either direct assistance, or by offering military veterans a chance to volunteer together and build camaraderie during charity events abroad. While they do many projects stateside, the chance to help build something in another country is healing for veterans in many ways: they get an opportunity to leave a legacy of support instead of destruction, war and chaos. It is as much a therapeutic exercise for veterans as it is for the subjects receiving the aid.
"Due to the fact that a lot of our military veterans have already been trained in conducting humanitarian operations in conflict areas, we are able to achieve a higher level of success in the community improvement operations that we undertake. A lot of the members are eager to utilize their skills to plan and conduct local and foreign charity events to help others in need," writes
CalltheCavary.org
founder Scott, a former Green Beret and genius organizer.
The crew with Staff at LADLE at the finished library
For this mission, we were  planning on traveling to the western part of Mexico at the end of May 2023 to help build a study area (with a small library or "ludoteca") in a local youth center for vulnerable children. With the help of donors, family and friends, we were able to get books, school supplies and even laptops for the organization called
Los Amigos De La Esquina (LADLE),
a non-profit dedicated to empowering Native Mayan and Mexican children in Tulum, Mexico since 2017.
Sanding wooden bookshelves for the new ludoteca
Surprisingly, the children and the staff had as much to teach us, as we had to contribute to them. Not only was I extremely surprised to see senior staff playing the Harmonium, an ancient Indian instrument rarely seen today, but they were chanting to calm the children and teach them powerful phrases, such as " I am the light, and everything I do shines from within me." Watching them use tried and tested methods such as tapping for anxiety and music for harmony and education, expanded my idea of the American education system and how we can improve our own process.
Meet the Volunteers
In true dramatic fashion, the last day of build was during a thunderstorm and the team was counting down the hours to the finished project for our grand reveal. From accessibility through laptops, to a robotic dog that could under Spanish commands, to a smorgasbord of taste and texture with fruits and dessert and bright colors, we departed the community with a sense of accomplishment and connection.
It was a leap of faith to take on a week long project with a group of veterans I had never met, and I walked into the situation with no expectations. In the end, I walked away with new friends and memories I will never forget and I hope other veterans have such a valuable experience to add to their repertoire.
This experience, of working through unknown situations with people speaking other languages, having limited tools and communication, and still being able to accomplish the mission we set out to do, is exactly what I love about being an American veteran. Give us a paper clip, some jet fuel and batteries and we can make anything happen! (that's a MacGyver reference for the Gen Z readers)
Our Sincere gratitude to donors for the supplies
To those who helped support and fund this library, our utmost gratitude and heartfelt regards. Looking forward to the next adventure with Call in the Cavalry! In an age often marked by apathy and disconnection, charitable actions serve as powerful reminders of the profound impact that kindness and generosity can have on our communities and the world at large. As we have seen throughout this article, this organization and these individuals work tirelessly, to uplift those in need, to mend societal fractures, and to act as beacons of hope and as a positive memory of what veterans can accomplish.
