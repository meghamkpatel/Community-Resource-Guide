What Members Are Saying
The Sacred Beauty Collective offered me a safe and supportive platform in which to explore not only the importance of clean beauty, but also the many aspects of what makes us all beautiful. The Collective changed the way I view beauty and the untapped power we have as women. Rebecca's warmth and openness solidified my ability to speak without feeling judged. I'm forever grateful for the opportunity to work with her and meet some incredible women.
Hilda
From pro makeup tips to discussions about spirituality and self-love, at times The Sacred Beauty Collective work was deep, emotional and challenging, but it was always fun, soul-stirring and meaningful. The Collective also brought together so many beautiful souls whom I now regard as sisters. Thank you, Rebecca, for leading with purpose, shining your light and being a catalyst for growth!

Chrystelle
Rebecca is a kindred spirit. She uses her knowledge to remind others to lean on the inner beauty and let that shine outwardly. She has helped me affirm that healing in community is the best way to make it last.

Sesheta
Since joining The Sacred Beauty Collective, my appreciation for Sisterhood has expanded 100-fold. The program - and the women in it - helped me stand more fully in my power in all aspects of my life. I also developed a deep love for blush and lipstick - two items that never existed in my makeup vocabulary ever before! ⁠Now, I feel safe and confident in my ability to play in the makeup world. Thank you, Rebecca!

Kelsey
Throughout my time in The Sacred Beauty Collective, I am reminded how important is to check in with myself, reflect and use the tools presented at our sessions. I am also excited to have met so many wonderful and supportive sisters. It’s so much easier to go through life when you know someone always has your back and all you just have to do is ask for help. Thank you for this beautiful journey, Rebecca⁠!

Meet your host
Hi, I'm Rebecca!
As a plant-based makeup artist, beauty coach and spiritual seeker for over 20 years, one of the bigges
t things I've learned is that
beauty is an inside job.
​
That why I created The Sacred Beauty Collective, a place for women to reconnect with our inherent beauty and lift one another up in the process.
