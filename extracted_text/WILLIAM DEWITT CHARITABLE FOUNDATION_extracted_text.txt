William O. DeWitt, III
President
Bill DeWitt III was named President of the St. Louis Cardinals in March, 2008. In his role as team President, DeWitt oversees all aspects of the team and its affiliates.
He led the effort to develop Ballpark Village, a mixed-use project adjacent to Busch Stadium which opened in 2014. In 2020, the Cardinals, along with their development partner The Cordish Companies, opened Phase II of the project which includes an office tower (The PwC Pennant Building), a 200 room boutique hotel (Live! by Loews), a 29-story luxury apartment tower (One Cardinal Way), a health club (Onelife Fitness), and additional retail and restaurants.
Before his appointment to team President, DeWitt was Sr. Vice President of Business Development with the Cardinals and oversaw the design and construction of the new Busch Stadium, which opened in April, 2006. Prior to that, he was involved in several merchandising, marketing, and operational projects for the team. DeWitt was also involved in the planning for Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium in Jupiter, Florida, where the Cardinals conduct Spring Training.
DeWitt, 55, graduated cum laude from Yale University in 1990. He then served as an assistant to William Reilly, head of the U.S. EPA in Washington D.C. He earned an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1995. DeWitt is a board member of the Rawlings Corporation, and his charitable affiliations include Cardinals Care (board chair), Big Brothers Big Sisters of Eastern Missouri, the St. Louis Sports Commission, and the Gateway Arch Park Foundation. DeWitt and his wife, Ira, live in St. Louis with their three children - daughter Natalie (24), son Will (21), and son Jabin (10). Bill enjoys golf, ice hockey, and painting in his free time.
