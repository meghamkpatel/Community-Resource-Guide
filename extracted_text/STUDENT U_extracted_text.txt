OUR APPROACH
SUPPORTING OUR STUDENTS' BRILLIANCE
Our approach focuses on uplifting communities and combines three key elements to achieving a Durham where all students succeed.
We take a whole-families approach to college access and success programming, which means that we consider everything that affects a student’s ability to show up fully and reach their potential. We provide intergenerational services and support to students and guardians over an 11-year pipeline.
WHOLE-FAMILIES
APPROACH
We are constantly growing and evolving in our best practices in working with first-generation college students, and we make sure those insights are accessible to Durham Public Schools, practitioners, and other key stakeholders.
SHARING OUR
BEST PRACTICES
We support student- and family-led advocacy and change efforts in our city with strategic partnerships that help parents and students develop the skills they need to shape their futures.
