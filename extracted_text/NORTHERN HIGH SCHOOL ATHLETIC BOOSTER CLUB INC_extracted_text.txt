Booster Memberships and Donations for 2023-24 are OPEN! Join us today and support our athletes and the Nighthawk Nation.
The NGHS Athletic Booster Club is a volunteer group made up of interested adults, which supports all athletic-related activities while promoting leadership, team spirit, and sportsmanship, both in the classroom and on the field. We do this by providing financial support to athletic teams that cannot be provided through the athletic fund for the school. Support is provided to all eligible groups on an equitable basis, J.V. and Varsity alike.
We look forward to new members and new projects this year.  Boosters are “
fun raisers”
, not just
fundraisers
. Our "fun" comes from the boosting and social activities we plan throughout the year.  Everyone can be a Booster.  Booster is simply an enthusiastic supporter of NGHS sports programs. This support can be in many ways -- by becoming a member of the booster club, joining committees, volunteering to work during sports events, being a team representative, through financial support, or by simply attending sports events to support our athletes.
We will be asking for your help and support throughout the year during our fundraising activities, but a significant portion of our funds will come from Booster Club memberships. The more funds generated through memberships, the less additional fundraising is needed. Our goal is 100% membership and representation of all our athletes and their families in the Booster Club. Consider joining and supporting your children and all our athletes at NGHS as Booster Club members.
Parental involvement is the key to establishing a tradition of successful support provided by the Booster Club. With strong parent and community support, we have been fortunate to assist Northern Guilford High School physically and financially, and we thank all those individuals who have donated their time, talent, and resources to our school.
Thank you for your support.
