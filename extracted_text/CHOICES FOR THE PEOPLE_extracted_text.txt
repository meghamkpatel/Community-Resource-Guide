OUR PHILOSOPHY
Choices for People Center, Inc. believes that people with disabilities have the same rights and the same responsibilities as other persons; and that the fundamental right of all human beings is to fulfill their potential as well as to make choices and exercise control over their own lives. It is each individual’s right to maximize his or her own quality of life.
OUR MISSION
Choices for People Center provides year-round support and instructional programs designed to aid individuals with disabilities in developing essential life skills.  These skills promote inclusion, independence, self-sufficiency, and productivity; and aim to maximize the individual’s quality of life in the least restrictive environment possible.
Choices for People Center assists in individual goal-oriented program planning, and acts as an advocate in the community through the removal of attitudinal, architectural, environmental, financial, employment-related, communicational, transportation, and other barriers.
OUR HISTORY
Choices for People Center was started in 1957, as the Rolla Cerebral Palsy School by a grassroots organization. It was created to fill a need for services for the disabled. A group of members and families from the community came together to provide services that were not available at the time.
In 1992, the name was changed to Choices for People Center, and focus was targeted towards adults who needed services. These services include Community Services, Day Services, Employment Services, and Residential Services. Choices for People Center is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation.
