[TOMT][1980's][TV/Music] Kids show similar to Kids Incorporated
Solved
I seem to remember a group that was around at the same time, or maybe even pre-Kids Incorporated that had a tv show and released albums of pop hits. Kind of like how Transformers and Go-Bots were both happening at the same time... was there a Go-Bots comparison to Kids Incorporated?
In particular, I remember having a cassette tape with them singing "Bette Davis Eyes," and since I can't find a reference to K.I. doing it, I figure it's gotta be someone else, right? Anyone remember?
