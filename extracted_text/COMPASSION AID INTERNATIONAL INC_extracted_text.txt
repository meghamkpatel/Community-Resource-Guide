Sponsor A Child
Jesus cares for the most vulnerable. Let’s follow him.
Millions of children around the world live in extreme poverty, unable to access even the most basic of needs. As the hands and feet of Jesus, we’re called to do something about it.
Compassion works to end child poverty by connecting children in need with local churches who care for them by fighting malnutrition, offering medical care and more. And most importantly, these churches share the hope of the gospel, which changes everything.
With these needs met, children can go from simply surviving to thriving — mind, body and soul. You can join us in delivering hope to the most vulnerable through child sponsorship. Together, we can end poverty and build God’s kingdom, one child at a time.

Urgent: Food Crisis Support Needed
The world is facing the worst food shortage in 70 years, and children in poverty are the most vulnerable. Hunger hinders a child’s development , harms their bodies and prevents them from doing their best in school. But with your support, we can equip local churches with the food kits and other essentials they need to fight back.
Join Us. Fight Hunger.

Why We Work
Sponsorship
“Poverty is like a box with no window, when all you see is darkness.”
— Dr. Jose Frank, Dominican Republic
Poverty  affects a child’s entire well-being. Physically, they may be sick or hungry. Emotionally, they may feel forgotten. And spiritually, they may feel utterly hopeless.
But through
child sponsorship
, you empower a nearby church to meet the critical needs of a child’s body, mind and spirit. Your support invites a child into a safe place where they belong — a place where they’re known, loved and protected.
When you become a sponsor, you’re personally connected with a child. Through letter writing and prayer, you’ll be a source of encouragement as they break free from the cycle of child poverty and realize their full potential in Jesus.
Your
monthly support
provides:
An introduction to the gospel of Jesus.
Health care, including an annual medical exam.
Hygiene training.
Malnutrition monitoring and intervention.
Education and vocational training.
Mentorship, love and belonging.
Sponsor a Child Today
How We Work
At Compassion International, it’s our goal to equip children to overcome child poverty and grow into their God-given potential. As a child sponsorship organization, with your support, we help local churches nurture and protect children through Christ-centered, church-driven and child-focused programs.
Christ-centered:
True transformation begins with the hope of the gospel, which is why we share Jesus with every child in a culturally relevant way. Christ’s love motivates us to serve children and families from all backgrounds, regardless of belief.
Church-driven:
Local churches already established in their communities know the needs of the children living around them best. This is why we work in partnership with local churches only, equipping them to know, love and protect children in the area.
Child-focused:
The whole child is our focus, and we work to address the critical needs of a child’s entire well-being. We tailor our support to each child’s unique circumstances and environment.

Why We Work
“What are you going to do?”
In 1952, this question haunted Rev. Everett Swanson after he saw the frozen bodies of children lying in the streets of South Korea. Moved with compassion, he answered by founding Compassion International.
Since then, that one act of compassion has grown into a network of 8,000+ local church partners in 29 countries fighting back against child poverty. Now we’re helping 2.3 million children and counting.
“My life is true confirmation that God has a plan for each one of us and has mysterious ways to fulfill the plan. The way
									God used sponsors through Compassion to transform my life is one of those mysteries.”
— Christine Uwase
Child Protection Officer, Rwanda
