FUND OVERVIEW
​
​
Established in 2011, the Lawrence & Artelia Perry Scholarship Fund focus is to assist in financial & moral support for students seeking to achieve higher education goals.
As set forth in the Articles of Incorporation, the
Lawrence & Artelia Perry Scholarship Fund (L&APSF)
is an IRS 501(c)(3) public corporation or
ganized exclusively for charitable and educational purposes. Established in 2011, the Board of Directors of the L&APSF governs the corporation to provide scholarships on the bases of merit and need to students who have attended the public schools in Durham and who are enrolled at Bennett College (Greensboro, NC), Livingstone College (Salisbury, NC), or North Carolina Central University (Durham, NC).
The L&APSF raises fund for scholarships through community events designed to honor persons who reflect the values and accomplishments of the funds’ namesakes, Lawrence and Artelia Perry; and through the sale of books that perpetuate their legacy.
Funds are awarded directly to students for purchases of supplies, equipment, or books; or to pay fees for academic and extracurricular activities, which are necessary for the student to profit maximally from the college experience.
Open to Livingstone College, Bennett College
and NCCU Students.
P.O. Drawer 2131 Durham, NC 27701
