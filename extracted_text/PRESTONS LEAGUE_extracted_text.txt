PATIENT STORIES
Dear Preston's League,
​
You define exactly what it means to be a league during this collective, challenging time in our world. You have come together for our Family Support Program to meet the needs for families facing medical challenges and social distancing during transplant with your weekly wish list program for years.
We cannot thank you enough for your willingness to continue to be an example of generosity, especially during this uncertain time. We value the creative ways you are joining with us to provide needed essentials and resources to the families on the Duke Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant (PBMT) and Cellular Therapy inpatient unit as you face your own challenges of social distancing.
Each and every donation, no matter the size, is bringing a moment of joy on the other side of it. The wishes we read about may include a pillow or mattress pad to make sleeping more comfortable for a caregiver, a crossword puzzle book or new toy to provide engagement and play between daily medical routines, or favorite snacks for patients that finally feel like eating again. Your donation is meeting families where they are in the moment, providing comfort and hope when it's needed the most.  We assess the COVID-19 situation day by day supporting our families and donors in the safest ways possible.
Thank you for your contributions as a league. We hope you take a moment to smile today knowing that you are a part of something meaningful!
​
Gratefully,
The Duke PBMT Family Support Program Team
