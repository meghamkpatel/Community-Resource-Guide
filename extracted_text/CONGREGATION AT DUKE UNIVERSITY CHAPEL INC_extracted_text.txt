The Congregation at
Duke University Chapel
is the interdenominational church home for people who consider the Chapel to be their primary place of worship. The Sunday morning service at 11:00 a.m. draws worshipers from all areas of campus as well as from many of our neighboring communities. Recognizing that the Christian life is more than a Sunday morning experience, members of the Congregation long to deepen their relationships with God, with each other, and with their neighbors. Through
education
,
mission
, and
fellowship
the Congregation helps us to strengthen these precious relationships.
We welcome singles, couples and families, students, faculty, staff, and community members to join our church as we grow in Christ together.
Our Mission Statement
Believing that God reaches out to us with love and forgiveness,
we seek to grow together in faith through worship, study, service and our life together.
Our Vision
To embody Christ’s compassion and holiness
Statement of Nondiscrimination and Inclusion
The Congregation at Duke University Chapel joyfully welcomes all persons
regardless of age, race, class, origin, sexual orientation, gender identity,
or any other distinction and invites membership
and participation in all of its ministries.
