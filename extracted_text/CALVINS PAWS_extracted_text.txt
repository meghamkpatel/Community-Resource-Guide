Calvin's Paws Needs You!
Our precious animals are dependent upon our all-volunteer
network of people in this non-profit organization to rescue
and care for them and help them find their forever home. They are always encouraging us to find people to serve them by offering to:
Donate
towards their care
Become a
Foster Parent
(Home)
Become an Adoption Counselor
Assist with transportation needs
Join our Staff or Administrative Team
The Community Needs You!
Thousands of animals are needlessly killed each year in shelters across our state because over population and limited space devalues their lives to a simple budget calculation. Your community needs people who understand the true value of our animals' lives willing to join groups like Calvin’s Paws who advocate for Spay/Neuter laws, engage in TNR (Trap and Release), and legislation that would ban Heart Stick and Gas Chamber euthanasia.
