Infrastructure
Aztec Node & RPC Server
Run a package of backend services needed to build and publish Aztec rollup blocks, query blockchain state, and execute simulated transactions.
Smart Contracts
Noir & Aztec.nr
Write smart contracts using a comprehensive framework that extends Noir with private smart contract functionality.
Testing Tools
Aztec.js & Aztec CLI
Interact seamlessly with a local instance of an Aztec node. Submit transactions, test contracts, and query blockchain state.
Write with Aztec.nr
A powerful new smart contract framework for Aztec applications.
Aztec.nr allows you to write privacy-first smart contracts with sweet syntax, seamless state management, and a sophisticated library of privacy primitives.

Sweet syntax
Aztec.nr is written in Noir, an open-source Rust-based zk language.
Write code, not circuits.
Seamless state management
Manage private state headache-free. No more reasoning about Merkle Trees. Just read and write to private storage.
Sophisticated privacy primitives
Import cryptographic primitives like ECDSA and SHA without the hassle of re-implementation.
