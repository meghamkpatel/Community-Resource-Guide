About The Host:
Word Harvest International is an apostolic organization designed to offer quality sacred covering for independent churches and ministries. The organization is committed to strengthening Episcopates, Pastors and Laity in the overall development and cultivation of the church. The organization is governed by the Holy Bible and specifically operates under the auspices of The Chief Apostle, Presiding Bishop Dr. James L. Spence.
Word Harvest International is committed to the assignment of preaching and teaching the principles and ministry of reconciliation. We believeÂ that each Christian is called to minister in some capacity. Therefore, we emphasize the teaching ministry and embrace Godâ€™s word as the government for living. It is the objective of this organization to serve as a conduit of deliverance for all who pursue liberty through Jesus Christ (St. Matthew 28:20)
