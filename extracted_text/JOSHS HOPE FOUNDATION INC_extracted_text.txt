Why Josh's Hope?
Josh’s Hope Foundation was established as a living memorial to Josh Bailey, who struggled with mental health, and was murdered in 2008 at the age of 20 by a gang in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. At Josh’s Hope, we believe that all young people struggling with mental health conditions deserve the support and resources they need to build a rewarding life. We welcome you by helping remove obstacles and creating opportunities. Join us.
