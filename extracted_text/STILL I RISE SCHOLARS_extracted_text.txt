About Us
Our Founder
Johnesha Truesdale is the founder and president of Still I Rise Scholars.
Our history
Still I Rise Scholars was founded on August 26, 2021. This organization was created to provide financial assistance to graduating high school seniors and returning college students. Our scholarship program is unique because we provide assistance to students who reside in subsidized  housing communities in the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill (RDU) area. We partner with local housing authority programs to identify our students.  We also seek to grow our program and provide other scholarship opportunities.
Our mission
The fundamental purpose of the Still I Rise Scholars program is to provide monetary assistance to underprivileged graduating high school students and/or current college students whose desire is to further their educational endeavors, but experience financial barriers in doing so. Our long-term goal is to also provide educational workshops and mentorship opportunities to students and our recent graduates.
