We caught up with the brilliant and insightful Frederick Poteat a few weeks ago and have shared our conversation below.
Alright, Frederick thanks for taking the time to share your stories and insights with us today. We’d love to have you retell us the story behind how you came up with the idea for your business, I think our audience would really enjoy hearing the backstory.
Looking at the state we’re in as a human-race, it’s clearly evident to me that the removal of GOD has tremendously impacted the mindset and values of people especially the youth. Music I grew up to inspired and motivated us to be better and do better. Majority of the music today glorifies drugs, sex, gangs, and money. Music is a spiritual phenomena that can influence one positively or negatively. With that being, I feel that it’s too much negativity in our communities, workplace, and world, in general. SYBI Music’s mission is to create great music with dope, rhythmic lyrics containing uplifting and positive messages over the illest beats with the sharpest and clearest production. All the while, encouraging BELIEVERS to represent the KINGDOM with swag & confidence and inspiring those who don’t know CHRIST to be encourage to try to know HIM. I feel that SYBI Music is solving a major problem by providing hope!
Great, appreciate you sharing that with us. Before we ask you to share more of your insights, can you take a moment to introduce yourself and how you got to where you are today to our readers
SYBI is a multi-faceted organization that offers plenty of products and services such as (but not limited to): music, apparel, sports skills training, consulting, motivational speaking, etc….SYBI means SUCCESSFUL YOUNG BLESSED INDIVIDUALS. Majority of our products and services are offered on our website at SYBIMUSIC.com. The first motivation for starting SYBI is that I felt the need to create something positive and uplifting. I also wanted to have something to leave behind for future generations. I wanted to provide hope for those suffering. I wanted to be the speaker for the less fortunate. We’re 100% independent and minority owned. Our 1st album VICTORIOUS debuted Top 100 Christian charts October 21, 2020. Our 2nd album Good Fruits Vol 1 debuted #17 Christian charts December 31, 2021. We created a women’s division entitled SUPACITA to celebrate those awesome GOD-fearing ladies out there doing their thing repping the KINGDOM. We also created a non-profit division entitled SYBI Cares, that focuses on supporting and aiding under-developed communities within the local community. What I’m most proud of that GOD is still using me despite my faults and failures. HIS love is amazing and I want every one to experience that endless love that I’ve experienced. We’re new to the social media world so we’re trying to catch up..LOL! For those that want to stay up to date, please follow us on Facebook (SYBImusic and SYBIcares), Instagram (officialSYBI), and YouTube.(SYBImusic)
Any stories or insights that might help us understand how you’ve built such a strong reputation?
1. Consistency- On the music side of things, every song has a purpose/message that connects with audience. From a personal standpoint, I feel that those that get to know me, know I’m going to keep 100 regardless.
2. Personality- I have an outgoing spirit. Love to laugh, have fun, joke, but I’m serious minded as well.
3. Humility-Success is not new to me so there’s no pressure in me having to do something out of character to achieve. I want to see everyb0dy win. The example for me comes from Jesus–HE did not come to be served but HE came to serve.
4. Fair Pricing- We’re not trying take all your money by offering products at ridiculous prices. We want to see everyone in SYBI Gear.
Can you share a story from your journey that illustrates your resilience?
1. I loss my money and so-called friends disappeared. 2. I loss my job that I had worked for over 10 years.
3. I’ve been battling diabetes for over 10 years and have chronic nerve pain all day, everyday but you wouldn’t know unless I told you.
4. I had no hand-outs. Nothing was planned for me. Nothing was handed down to me. I was verbally and physically abused as a child. (not sexually)
5. COVID-19 hospitalized me for 2 weeks. Fever of 104.5 for 10 days straight. Loss my eye-sight for several days.
BUT LOOK AT GOD!!!
