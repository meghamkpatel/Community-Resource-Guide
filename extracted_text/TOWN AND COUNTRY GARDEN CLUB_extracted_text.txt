Welcome Gardeners!
Thank you for visiting our website.  Our Club's vision is to encourage friendships and extend our knowledge of horticulture by visiting gardens, inviting speakers to our meetings and sharing our gardening experiences with each other.  We learn from each other and this is how "WE GROW."
Our club was founded in 1956. In 2024 we celebrate our 68th year as
a garden club.
​
We have been a member of
The Garden Club Federation of Pennsylvania
and
National Garden Clubs Inc
for  over 60 years!
Some of our activities include: bus trips, an annual plant sale, scholarships to students, caring for the environment, a quarterly newsletter, community projects, craft workshops and flower shows.  See our web pages for additional details.
The club's meetings are usually held on the first Wednesday of the month, March through December, at 7 p.m. often in the Bachman Center of Homestead Village in the Rohrerstown area of Lancaster County.
