May 2024 Song of the Month
Dave Para introduces
“Seth Davy”
by Glyn Hughes, also known as “Come Day, Go Day” or “Whiskey on a Sunday.” Seth Davy was a Jamaican sailor who entertained children on the streets of Liverpool around the turn of the 20th century.
From the Mic Episode 23: Cis Hinkle
The latest guest on
From the Mic
is Cis Hinkle. Cis has delighted contra and square dancers since 1985 with her skilled teaching, welcoming manner, playful enthusiasm and masterful selection of dances. She talks with Mary about
the first time she stumbled into a contra dance in her native Atlanta; shares how she overcame stage fright and began calling all over the world; and brings us right up to her most recent pursuit, learning to call modern western squares.
From the Mic Episode 22: David Millstone
Mary’s guest on this episode of
From the Mic
is David Millstone. David started contra dancing with Dudley Laufman in the early 1970s and has been calling dances for forty-five years: contras old and new, squares from different regional traditions, English country dances, and plenty of family-friendly events.
