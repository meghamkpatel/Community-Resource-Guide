WELCOME TO LABOUR OF LOVE  MINISTRIES
We are here for you. It is our Labour of Love to help you and your family be what you are meant to be through sound biblical teaching. Choices are a never-ending part of life. Through our monthly Bible Studies, we can help you be more confident in the choices that you will continually have to make in life. The Bible has answers. Let us explore those answers together and show you that God does love you and He does have a plan for your life, even if you think you’ve missed the mark.
Learn how to know the direction that you need to be going in to make the right choices for you and your loved ones. Learn how to get back on track and renew the passion and excitement of life that comes from having a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ. Therefore, it is our
Labour of Love
to help you to get to know Jesus Christ for yourself, and or strengthen your relationship with him through sound Biblical teachings that is found only in the Word of God.
If you’re ready to get help, we’re ready and He’s always ready to help!
