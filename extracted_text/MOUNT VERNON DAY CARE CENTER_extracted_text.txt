Organization Profile
Mount Vernon Day Care Center
https://westcop.org
The Mount Vernon Day Care Center, Inc. is a historic not-for-profit childcare organization established in 1891. We offer a balanced approach to learning for pre-school and school-aged children. The Center is proud of its significant and celebrated service to youth, families and the greater Mount Vernon community. Our expertly designed programs meet childrenýs intellectual, social, emotional and physical needs while having fun. The staff understands the developmental requirements of the "total" child, and we encourage the participation and involvement of the parents and family in the Centerýs programs.  Within this nurturing environment, each child receives the tools they need to become confident and self-aware, as well as opportunities to become inspired, to learn, to imagine, and grow.
