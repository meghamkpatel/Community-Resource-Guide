Distributing Dignity Across North Carolina
Distributing Dignity Across North Carolina; Providing essential products to help families thrive at all stages of life.
Our vision is every family in North Carolina will have access to basic necessities to support their dignity, health, and quality of life.
Most of us do not spend a lot of time thinking about diapers. But if you are a parent, grandparent, or caregiver without enough of them, they can become a major source of stress, guilt, and desperation. Public safety net programs such as The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, previously known as Food Stamps) do not cover the purchase of diapers, often leaving families with a difficult decision between buying diapers and other necessities with their limited funds. For families in need, something as small as a diaper can have a significant impact.
