Welcome to the daniel center For Math and Science
For Every Child...
The mission of The Daniel Center for Math and Science (The Daniel Center) is to narrow the education gap for at-risk and disadvantaged children; and to prepare and motivate these young people to pursue a post-high school education through proven teaching, tutoring, and learning experiences.
Children enroll in our 5-Star Pre-k child care program at 3 or 4-year olds; or can be enrolled in our 5-Star pre-teen child care program, which serves kids from 5 to 12-years old. At age 13, students move into our teen component, where we focus on college readiness, career exploration, and life skills.
Ours is a comprehensive, long-term education enhancement program, which guides the success of our students from Pre-k to college!
OUR PROGRAM SETS CHILDREN ON THE PATH TO SUCCESS!
