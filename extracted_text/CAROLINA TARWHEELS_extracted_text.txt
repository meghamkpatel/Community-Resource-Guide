What we’re about
The
Carolina Tarwheels Bicycle Club
is a non-profit (501c) organization welcoming all cyclists who enjoy riding with great folks who share the same passion.  Our goals are to offer weekly organized bike rides for all levels of riders, to promote safe cycling, to provide bi-monthly club meetings with topics relevant to cycling, and to host one of the best organized rides in the area, our annual
Bikefest
event in Hillsborough.
Money raised by the Tarwheels is donated to other non-profit organizations that support cycling including organizations that donate bikes to children, promote safety, and promote cycling.
Our members also serve on various cycling advocacy committees in our community as a voice for cyclists and to integrate our sport safely with pedestrians and motorists.
We welcome new members and encourage individuals to
join
our organization, enjoy our rides and social activities while promoting our sport and supporting our community.

B18 -  **8:10am**
Wilson Park, Carrboro, NC
This is a group ride aiming to average 18 (+/- 0.5 ) mpg. A "constant effort" paceline group, slow up, fast down. Those in front need to be aware of group (increasing power creates gaps) and call out location of holes.
In order to manage paceline size there is a limit of 20 participants (may vary depending on ride leader availability) and RSVP IS REQUIRED for all riders who either start at WP or plan to join the ride on the road. If you plan to join the ride in progress, please leave a comment below about where we can expect to meet you. Please bring a mask for use when physical distance cannot be maintained (e.g., rest stops, roadside mechanicals) and observe standard courtesy of waiting to spit or blow nose until you've rotated to back of paceline.
Your responsibility as part of the group is to RSVP and supply your own cue sheet or download the GPS file.
This week's route:
The week's route is typically posted by Thursday night.
It is Tarwheels policy for all riders to sign the ride waiver before coming out to the ride.
