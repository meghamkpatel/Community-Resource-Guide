Cooper Biersach is the co-founder of the
Family Enterprise Center
at the University of North Carolina’s Kenan-Flagler Business School. She teaches undergraduates and MBA students, facilitates roundtable peer groups, and delivers educational programming to multi-generational families.  Since 2009, Cooper has worked with over 1,000 next generation leaders and their families.  Drawing on her experience as a non-family executive, Cooper provides leadership coaching, succession planning, governance, and communication consulting to privately-held businesses and family enterprises.
Cooper served as the Senior VP, Worldwide Human Resources and a member of the Executive Committee of a family-owned company,
Jack Morton Worldwide
, a global brand experience and communications agency. In her role, she faced firsthand many of the challenges and opportunities of a family-run business — exponential growth, succession planning, leadership development, acquisitions, global pressures, and the transition of the business by sale to a publicly traded holding company
(Interpublic Group)
. She is the founding director of the Carolinas Family Office Forum, a networking and educational peer group for top executives of family offices in North and South Carolina.
Cooper received her BA in English at UNC-Chapel Hill, followed by her MBA and JD with honors. She holds an executive certificate in Leadership Coaching from Georgetown University’s Institute for Transformational Learning and is an
Associate Certified Coach
with the International Coaching Federation.
