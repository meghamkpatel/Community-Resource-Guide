Welcome
"Our Children,Our Commitment,Our Concern"
A Message From Our President
I greet you in the
Ghanaian spirit of Sankofa!
During this biennium, to more effectively and efficiently serve children, I will focus on lessons learned from many sources.  Among those is the symbolic meaning of the Sankofa bird to my position as National President.  The Sankofa philosophy stresses the importance of reaching back to retrieve and retain
knowledge gained in the past to apply in the present to succeed in the future.
That is a promising message of OPPORTUNITY!
Our past
provides valuable lessons on the
CONSISTENCY
with which we adhere to our founding standards and principles.
Our present
provides the opportunity to realign ourselves in
CAMARADERIE
to devote the best of our individual strengths, talents, and resources to apply promising practices harmoniously and unselfishly to our tasks for children.
Our future
visualizes continuing success as we realize our administrative and programmatic goals in
HEER
(Health, Education, Employment, and Recreation)
plus
Arts and Humanities
.
Our ultimate reward
is the evidence-based improvement in the quality and quantity of our positive impact on the children in each
COMMUNITY
we serve.  And
our blessing
is that, for over half a century, we have maintained allegiance to our traditions while we set an admirable pace to improve the future for children and families with targeted focus on
reducing the devastating effect of Diabetes and advocating for greater emphasis on Child Mental Health
.
I welcome your continuing enthusiastic support as we remain motivated by
a past that guides our
CONSISTENCY
, a present that strengthens our
CAMARADERIE
, and a future that serves our
COMMUNITY
.  That, is the
spirit of Sankofa
and the
spirit of Continental Societies, Inc.®
I invite you to visit our website regularly to keep abreast of our mission and our successes.
