Our work spans all of Durham.
Our current projects range from dog parks to pickleball courts. And one of our bigger past projects was helping to fund the West Point on the Eno Environmental Education Pavilion in 2019. Learn more about Durham Parks Foundation’s impact.
Our Projects
“Our parks, trails and green spaces are some of the greatest resources we can leverage in our ongoing pursuit of creating an equitable and inclusive shared environment within our community.”
David Green, Durham Parks Foundation President
Make a gift today.
Every amount, every dollar, makes a difference.
You are invited to make a general gift that will go toward the greatest needs within Durham parks. If you have a specific park or project that you want to support, you can earmark your gift for park accessibility, pickleball, Sandy Creek Park in South Durham, and other local projects funded by DPF. Every gift is tax-deductible and will benefit Durham parks in some way!
We appreciate your support!
