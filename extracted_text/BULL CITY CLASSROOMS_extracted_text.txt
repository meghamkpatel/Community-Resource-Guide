BULL CITY CLASSROOMS
Sign up for an event today!
Who we are
Bull City Classrooms is a nonprofit organization with the goal to get the incredible Durham community involved in local classrooms. Durham teachers are underpaid and overworked — our goal is to address the latter.
Sign up for our upcoming events mailing list today!
What we do
We organize two hour blitz volunteer sessions on Saturday mornings where groups of 20+ volunteers help teachers with whatever they need.  This includes activities such as cleaning/sorting out closets and science experiment kits, making folder packets, and moving desks.  Basically, labor intensive tasks that would take a single teacher a few days, but only two hours for a large group of volunteers. Interested?

How it works
Most folks don't have the flexibility to commit to volunteering on a regular basis and teachers don't have the bandwidth to commit to having a group of volunteers come in on a regular basis.  That's where we come in.  Teachers and principals contact us on an as-needed basis whenever they need a group of volunteers and we connect them to groups of volunteers.
Upcoming events
Our Sponsors
Bull City Classrooms are sponsored by the following incredible local businesses and Duke University.  Interested in becoming a sponsor? Email us today!
Do you have a group of volunteers ready to help? Contact us and we'll get you in touch with a Durham public school.
