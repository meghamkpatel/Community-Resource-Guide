OUR SCHOOL
Our Philosophy
Preschool of the Warm Heart believes that every child is precious and unique. We provide a loving and safe Christian environment where children flourish.  Our
play-based
curriculum has been carefully developed by our staff to be age appropriate and engaging.  The natural outdoor play areas
offer
wonderful opportunities for learning, creative play, and social interaction.  In addition, all class attend music weekly and the twos, threes and fours celebrate God during Chapel Time held once a week in the church sanctuary.
Preschool of the Warm Heart
welcomes ALL children and celebrates diversity.  Preschool of the Warm Heart is a member of the
Durham Orange Preschool Association
, a collaboration of preschools that work together for the betterment of early childhood education.
We invite you to come see our classrooms, meet our staff and wander through our playground.  Come visit us and experience the joy of Preschool of the Warm Heart!
