Hi everyone,
I have talked with an Army recruiter a few times about the army's street to seat WOFT program and have i am interested but have some questions that maybe you guys could help me out with.  I have a bach' and a masters degree that don't pertain to aviation. I have always wanted to serve in the military though.  I have worked in the sports medicine field as an ATC with the military for approx 7 years, 5 of those years with special operations.  My sports medicine background doesn't really give me any lead way towards any type of MOS other than administration which i am not interested in. I just talked with the recruiter yesterday and we broke down what needs to be done.  If i move forward with this  i would be looking at 86 weeks of training from basic through flight school. I am 29, which my recruiter said isnt much of an issue, which i defenitly didnt believe him.  Is this even possible for me or is this recruiter setting me up to fail?  The biggest worry i have is failing out of flight school because i have no background in it and then the army throwing me into some whirl wind for the next 3 years. I dont have a worry about applying and getting in because of my background and my letters of rec that i have. i am just more worried about the fact of failing out and getting stuck in the "machine".  The recruiter has been in for 19 years and said "i have never heard or seen any WOFT candidate failing out of this program" which cannont be true i have worked with the army in the past and know that flight school is a long and difficult.  Anyone that can help me or give some background on their experience would be really helpful.
Thank you!

Bro you’re over thinking it.. 90% of people who go flight don’t have any experience in aviation. I’m not saying it isn’t possible to fail but that shouldn’t be one of your concerns.

The Army uses a very large broom to push people through flight school. Pretty much the only way to not graduate is to quit, you can be a terrible pilot and the Army will still graduate you and make you your next unit's problem to deal with.

(Disclaimer: I’m not a warrant, I’m an O-grade) You’re asking the wrong questions dude. If you have a masters I’m sure you’ll have no trouble getting through flight school (excluding some unfortunate event or medical condition). The question you should be asking is “Do I want to live the life of a Warrant Officer?” It’s hard and it’s frustrating. Look into that. You’ll be taking orders from some pock-marked kid fresh out of a bachelors degree, working long hours, probably not flying as much as you’d like, and dealing with big-army bullshit. If that’s worth it to you then by all means join us. To me the flying and the mission are worth it. Not so for everyone.

As a Recruiter, I would recommend you go through with the process. Take the SIFT, take the Flight physical. If you pass those, then decide if you want OCS or WOFT. I recommend WOFT but either way. Don’t over think this, and don’t worry yourself out of a great opportunity. risk is usually worth the reward. Your initial contract is 3 years until you become a Warrant. Referencing the above comments, you should be good.

You should see some of the people skating through flight school. I know a kid who failed literally every single PT test (BCT, WOCS, WOBC, SELECTION APFT), has been late several times to every phase of training, and failed multiple tests. Still going strong.
I've also seen very good dudes, who are naturally bad at flying, get recycled a few weeks with success. Besides quitting, it's almost impossible to fail out. The very few people who have trouble grasping the actual flying (not the hardest part of school) figure it out just a little bit later than everyone else.
You're gonna be disappointed with how the Army turns out, but if you think you'll appreciate the mission/flying like
@walkerman180
said, it'll be worth it.
Edit: Surprisingly, everything you said you think the recruiter is lying about is true. Never said that before.

Thank you everyone for the help and advice! I really appreciate it! I went and talked with the recruiter yesterday and he had me take a quick PIP test at the office just to double check my color vision.  He said its the same color vision test that they will administer at MEPs.  Well apparently i am red/green color deficient which i had no clue i ever had this issue.  I can see red and green fine but apparently different shades i cant see or make out the number thats in the plates.  After the test he just looked at me and said "well thats an automatic disqualifier".  I thought i should make an eye appointment and get that checked for sure because at 29 yo i never knew that i had color blind issues.  I have done some research online that a lot of the time if you fail the PIP test you can take other tests and pass just fine but its mainly up to MEPs to determine what test they want to test you on not just me requesting a different test.  Anyone else have this issue, and what did you do to get by it?

Maybe just ask to do it again? Those tests can be weird. I wouldn't try finding a way to cheat the test. If it's an honest problem, you shouldn't try sneaking through it. I would assume it equates to important vision requirements such as flying with NVGs or systems, etc.

As everyone says, you need to be in the top 98% of your class to graduate. Everyone that finishes Army flight school will be a copilot ONLY. That being the case, the Army can push through marginal students.
Why aren't you looking at the other services for flight training? Especially now that the Army commitment is 10 years after winging. 11 plus years is along time if you're not enjoying the suck.
Navy 32, or AF 33 (On their website)

From what my recruiter has showed me is after flight school I would have 6 years of service. Air Force is 10 years at least from what I've been informed.

As of 3 Jun 20, the Secretary of the Army has approved the commitment for Army flight school to 10 years UPON graduation effective 1 Oct 20. I  believe the Sec of the Army has more say so than your recruiter.  Air Force and the Army are running neck and neck in commitment. Which one do you want to choose?
If selected, you can choose your aircraft and location with the AF ANG or AF Res, very competitive.

Honestly, the memo was dated 03 Jun, but wasn't in general public until two days ago. Good chance they didn't know about it, but also good chance they may hide it from you too. I had recruiters convinced BN interviews were still a thing last month.

When you sign a military contract before attending active duty training, you are not obligated to serve. You can literally change your mind on the day of shipment (google it). You are not being paid while waiting. Therefore you are not under any obligation in going. Of course, a recruiter may forget to tell you this minor point. Maybe he/she is absent minded.

Dude, I would never join the Army with a 10 year commitment AFTER getting wings.  No f*cking way.  It's not worth that much of your life.  That's coming from someone who really enjoyed being there.

Warrant Officers can always find a way. Fail 2 PT Tests, Medical Discharge, DUI, PCS and then take 6 months of leave to start your own business... there's always a way.

He's talking about being a POS and purposely getting yourself kicked out so you don't have to fulfill your obligation.
