New York Natural Heritage, Chief Ecologist,
Greg Edinger Presents
Greg Edinger, Chief Ecologist for NY Natural Heritage Program explains the map
​
As part of BkC's developing a land management plan, the NYNHP sponsored and conducted initial ecological surveys of BkC's three preserves - Schmidt Meadow Preserve, (in Jackson) Livingston Brook Rookery (in Greenwich) and Rexleigh Marble Mill (in Salem).
In our January Speaker Series, Greg Edinger, Chief Ecologist for NYNHP highlighted the findings and how these studies can be instrumental in BkC's land management plans.  The studies will help to inform, strategize and prioritize future conservation efforts along the full reach of the Battenkill.  The full talk can be viewed on our Facebook page at this

A Healthy Riparian Buffer: The Before & After of Transitioning a Field to Hay
​
The flooded riparian riverbank
Post riparian planting riverfront buffer.
Volunteer wildflowers with nutrient rich grasses to help the soil recover.
The trees and shrubs we planted are thriving (despite some hungry beavers); Planting small trees & shrubs help shore up riparian areas of small and large streams. Just take a look at the before & after photos. Thanks to
ElHannon Nursery
& a local farmer who appreciates why flood plains are better left to hay.
