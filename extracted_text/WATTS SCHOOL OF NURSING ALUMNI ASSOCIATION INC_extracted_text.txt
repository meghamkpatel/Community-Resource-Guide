Description
The memorial consists of a pole mounted decorative steel plaque describing the history of Lincoln Hospital and a large metal oil lamp  on a squat granite block with sloped side dedicated to the Lincoln Hospital School of Nursing. Four sets of stone tiles have been laid into ground around the lamp memorial. Each set depicts a building associated with the history of the hospital or nursing school: Lincoln Hospital 1901-1925, Lincoln Hospital 1925-1976, Angier B. Duke Nurses Home 1925-1975 and the Stokes Graduate Nurses Residence. The plaque and lamp stand near each other in a somewhat hourglass shaped landscape area formed by white gravel and interspersed with larger gray stones. Memorial pavers have been placed in the immediate area around each of the markers.
