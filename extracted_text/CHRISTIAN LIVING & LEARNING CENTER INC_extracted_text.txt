The Non-Profit Difference
CLC is a mission-driven,
non-profit organization
. We are different than for-profit
senior living communities
, which are designed to generate profits for shareholders and owners. As a non-profit, we must, of course, ensure sound business practices. But all profits are re-invested back into our communities and the organization to ensure we can continue to meet our mission of
enriching the lives of older adults
.

Hear From Residents
We have been residents at Clermont Park in Denver for four months. Since arriving here we have greeted by everyone with friendliness and enthusiasm. The people who live here are warm and welcoming. I can’t say enough about the staff, from the executive director to the custodians all are accommodating and go out of their way to assist. I love people and have worked and/or volunteered all of my life. I have never seen a group where there is no one who might be called a sour apple. They are, one and all, peaches. On another note. Clermont Park is beautiful and wonderfully maintained. It is a pleasure to be here.
Genevieve C Roland
Resident
Due to health issues we decided a retirement community was a good idea for us. We have never regretted moving here. The residents are welcoming, friendly and very interesting. There are many activities to become involved in depending upon your interests. It’s a warm, up-lifting, stimulating environment that totally feels like home. It’s also a comfort to us and our family that we will never have to move again. We are definitely at home!
