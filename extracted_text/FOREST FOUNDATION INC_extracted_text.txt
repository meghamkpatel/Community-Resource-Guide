The Forest Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that
provides assistance, training and services in green business development. We also create, produce and market products and services to promote sustainability, resiliency, self-sufficiency, heightened educational experiences and improved socio-economic interactions. We’ve been promoting transformative models for sustainable livelihoods since 2001.
