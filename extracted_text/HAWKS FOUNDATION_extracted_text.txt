Atlanta Hawks Foundation
The Atlanta Hawks Foundation's mission is to increase access for metro Atlanta's youth to play, grow and learn life and leadership skills through basketball.
The foundation will achieve this mission by focusing on two key areas:
Basic Access to Courts and Play
– The Atlanta Hawks Foundations will improve and increase the availability of basketball courts and provide scholarships to Hawks camps and clinics.
Volunteer Coaching Development
– Of the 6.5 million youth coaches, only 1 in 3 say they have been trained in sport skills or tactics, according to the Aspen Institute's Project Play. The Foundation will partner with trusted leaders in developing curricula to ensure Hawks clinics are delivering high-level instruction for volunteer coaches.
