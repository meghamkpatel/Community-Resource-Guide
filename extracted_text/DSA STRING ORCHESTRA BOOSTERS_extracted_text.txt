Welcome to the Durham School of the Arts String Orchestra program.
​
The award-winning DSA String Orchestra program provides students in grades 6-12 with the opportunity to learn violin, viola, cello and concert bass. Our mission is to unlock the creativity in each student and help them grow as musicians.
Playing a string instrument and learning to read music takes hard work and practice, but the rewards last a lifetime. Students can enter the program as beginners or audition into higher-level classes, and they can learn for fun or make it their arts pathway.
The orchestra performs regularly at DSA, around Durham, NC, and at in-state and out-of-state competitions. Additionally, individual students are encouraged to audition for regional and state-wide orchestras. We schedule a lot of performances because we believe all that hard work should be heard.
We are a self-supporting organization with a dedicated booster club and we encourage all families to
join us
in supporting our students in their musical journey.
