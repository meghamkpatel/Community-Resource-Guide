With our partners, Blueprint NC works towards inclusive and anti-racist democracy rooted in civic engagement through movement building and mobilization.
Ongoing Commitment
Blueprint NC is a progressive ecosystem of over 85 formal partner 501(c)(3) organizations and an expanding web of network allies committed to building people power for an anti-racist, inclusive democracy. We employ a number of tactics under each of these areas, and we reaffirm our deepened commitment to the existing work. We will continue and strengthen the coordination and support of partners’ voter registration work, data administration, conducting research that helps to keep us safe, outreach to voters and communities who are often underserved, and nonpartisan get out the vote.
