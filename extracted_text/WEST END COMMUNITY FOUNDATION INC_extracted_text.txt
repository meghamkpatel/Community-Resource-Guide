Our community. Our center.
Welcome to the Community Family Life and Recreation Center at Lyon Park! We extend a warm invitation for you to participate in the various activities we have to offer.
Established a century ago, our center originally served as a school for African-American children in Durham’s West End neighborhood. Thanks to the West End Community Foundation, Inc., it has been rejuvenated and transformed into a modern facility featuring amenities such as a gym, auditorium, computer lab, meeting rooms, and a diverse range of programs, from summer camps to a health clinic.
Feel free to visit us. Bring your children, bring your neighbors. Engage in a game of basketball, dance in our studio, or organize a gathering. Stay connected by signing up for our
e-newsletter
and explore our presence on social media.
We look forward to seeing you soon!
