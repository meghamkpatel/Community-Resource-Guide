Bull City Express Track Club is a USATF Certified Youth Track and Field Club with federal
501-©-3 tax status. It is our mission to develop youth, particularly at-risk youth in Durham, mind, body and soul. With an emphasis on competitive track and field, our youth vigorously train with our staff. We mentor our youth and teach them to only accept “THEIR” best.
Our goal is to get them in the habit of always trying to outperform themselves. Once they learn that concept, they’ll understand that every practice and meet is an opportunity to show their greatness. Lastly, in this individualized team sport, the concept of T.E.A.M. (Together Everyone Accomplishes More) is something that we stress is important for success not only on the track but in life. We have a saying that all of our youth have to buy into; “Everyone is special or nobody
is special”. Which one applies here? They always
choose that they all are special.
