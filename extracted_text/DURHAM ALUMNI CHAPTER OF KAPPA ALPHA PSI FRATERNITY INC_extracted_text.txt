WELCOME TO THE DURHAM(NC) ALUMNI CHAPTER
Greetings and welcome to the official website of the Durham (NC) Alumni Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc.  My name is Rashad L. Morgan and I serve as the 43rd Polemarch.
The Durham (NC) Alumni Chapter was founded on September 12, 1921 as the first graduate fraternity in the City of Durham. For nearly 100 years, our chapter has been dedicated to being a part of and supporting the Durham community.  The Bull City Kappas believe that we are the community that we serve, and thus, we aim to remain a constant presence and to be drivers of change in order to better the lives of our people.
As we head into our centennial year, we are faced with the challenges raised by the current pandemic.  We will continue to follow the guidelines and protocols provided by the State of North Carolina in order to assure the safety of our members and our community supporters.  Despite these challenges, our chapter will remain engaged in community service, from partnerships with area non-profit organizations to mentoring our youth through our national service program, Guide Right.
While our face-to-face interactions may be limited during this time, we encourage you to continue to support the events of the Durham (NC) Alumni Chapter.  Please check this site, as well as our Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook pages, to remain up to date on all of our activities.
Thank you, Durham, and we look forward to sharing with you our next hundred years of Achievement!
Respectfully yours,
Rashad L. Morgan
