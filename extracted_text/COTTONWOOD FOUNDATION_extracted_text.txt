Cottonwood Foundation is now a private foundation
As of January 1, 2013, Cottonwood Foundation has become a private foundation. This transition was made to decrease the time and energy required for fundraising and extensive communication activities.
From 1992 through 2012, Cottonwood Foundation was a public grantmaking charity. See the final report and newsletters for those years at
