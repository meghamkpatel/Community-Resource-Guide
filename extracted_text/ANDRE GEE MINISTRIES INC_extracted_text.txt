in the

since 2016, representing the

until December 2022 when he resigned to sit as an

over the party's opposition to an
Indigenous Voice to Parliament
.
Gee is a lawyer by profession. He served in the
New South Wales Legislative Assembly
from 2011 to 2016, representing the seat of
Orange
. He was elected to the House of Representatives at the
2016 federal election
. From 2020 to 2022 he held ministerial office in the
Morrison government
, serving as
Minister for Decentralisation and Regional Education
(2020–2021),
Veterans' Affairs
(2021–2022) and
Defence Personnel
(2021–2022).
Early life
[
edit
]
Gee was born on 13 September 1968 in
Wagga Wagga
,
New South Wales
.
[2]
As a child he lived with his family for periods in
Nairobi
and
San Francisco
, before they returned to Australia and settled in
Maitland
. He attended
Newcastle Grammar School
, where his history teacher was
Patricia Forsythe
. He subsequently went on to the
University of Sydney
, where he graduated with the degrees of
Bachelor of Economics
(
Hons.
) and
Bachelor of Laws
, residing at
St Paul's College
.
[3]
[4]
After commencing practice as a solicitor, Gee started a business with his brothers David and Matthew licensing consumer products and promotions for international entertainment companies. He was based in Hong Kong and his brothers were based in Singapore.
[4]
He was interviewed by the
South China Morning Post
prior to the
1998 federal election
, correctly predicting that
Pauline Hanson
would fail to be re-elected to parliament.
[5]
He returned to Australia in 1999 and began working for Colin Biggers & Paisley, becoming a
barrister
in 2003. Together with his wife and young children, Gee moved to
Orange
in 2005.
[6]
His legal practice was in the fields of civil litigation and family law, and had offices in Queen's Square Chambers in Orange and Sydney.
[3]
Politics
[
edit
]
Since youth, Gee had already been involved with the Nationals, "grew up handing out how to votes for the National Party" and "took National Party stickers to school and handed them out".
[7]
State politics
[
edit
]
Following an earlier announcement that the Nationals' sitting member for
Orange
,
Russell Turner
, would not be seeking re-election, Gee was endorsed by the National Party as its candidate in June 2010, after a pre-selection battle with three other candidates.
[8]
During his election campaign, Gee was diagnosed with
melanoma
and given a 50% chance of survival.
[9]
At the
March 2011 election
, Gee was elected and received a swing of 12.5 points towards the Nationals in the traditionally strong Nationals seat, winning 74.2% of the
two-party
vote.
[10]
Gee's main competitor was John Davis, an
independent
candidate, Mayor of
Orange
, former Councillor on
Blayney Shire Council
, and local car dealer.
Federal politics
[
edit
]
On 30 April 2016, Gee was preselected by the National Party to contest the seat of
Calare
at the
2016 federal election
,
[11]
and resigned from his state seat before the federal election.
[12]
The
by-election to fill the vacancy
was not held until 12 November 2016.
Gee won the seat of
Calare
at the
federal election
on 2 July 2016.
[2]
In January 2019, Gee was appointed Assistant Minister to the
Deputy Prime Minister
,
Michael McCormack
. He held the position until a ministerial reshuffle in February 2020, when he was elevated to the outer ministry as
Minister for Decentralisation and Regional Education
and Minister Assisting the
Minister for Trade and Investment
.
[2]
Gee supported challenger
Barnaby Joyce
against incumbent leader
Michael McCormack
in the
2021 Nationals leadership spill
. He had previously been regarded as a McCormack supporter, with his shift regarded as key in Joyce's victory.
[13]
As a result of his support, he was appointed as
Minister for Veterans' Affairs
and
Minister for Defence Personnel
and was elevated to cabinet.
[14]
He served as Minister until May 2022, following the appointment of the
Albanese ministry
.
On 26 March 2022, Gee gave a press conference in which he threatened to resign as a minister if additional funding was not provided in the Federal budget to address a backlog of claims from veterans. At this time the budget was scheduled to be handed down three days later. Prime Minister
Scott Morrison
said that the measure would receive initial funding in the budget, and that Gee was unfamiliar with how the budget process worked. A member of the Nationals told ABC News that Gee should have advocated for the funding months earlier if he had wanted to lock it in.
[15]
On 23 December 2022, Gee announced that he would be leaving the National Party and sitting as an independent after the Nationals' announcement that they would be opposing the
Indigenous Voice to Parliament
. Gee noted in a statement, "I can't reconcile the fact that every Australian will get a free vote on the vitally important issue of the Voice, yet National Party MPs are expected to fall into line behind a party position that I fundamentally disagree with, and vote accordingly in parliament."
[16]
[17]
[7]
Notably, his electorate had one of the highest percentage of "No" in the
2023 Australian Indigenous Voice referendum
, with 71.21% of the electorate's respondents voted "No".
[18]
Political positions
[
edit
]
In his maiden speech to Federal Parliament, Gee supported fixed parliamentary terms of four years.
[4]
On 30 November 2022, despite the National Party indicating an opposition to a proposed Indigenous Voice to Parliament, Gee announced his continued support and his intention to vote in favour of the Voice to Parliament.
[19]
This eventually culminated in his resignation from the party a month later.
Personal life
[
edit
]
Gee
surfs
and has played
rugby union
games with the Orange Emulators, a recreational "Golden Oldies" team. He won the
Mumbil
Black Wattle Fair's Chuck Akubra contest twice, in 2012 and 2014: participants compete to throw an
Akubra
hat the farthest.
