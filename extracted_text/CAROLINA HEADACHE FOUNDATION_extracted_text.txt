Headache News, Tips and Announcements
It is with a heavy heart that we announce the passing of Dr. John Douglas Mann. Throughout his rich history with our practice, Dr Mann offered compassionate care to patients, mentorship and leadership to colleagues, and kindness and generosity of spirit to all who knew him. He was well known and admired throughout academia as professor and clinician, and greatly contributed to medical research in a variety of ways. It was a privilege to work alongside him professionally, and a true honor to call him friend. His humor, gentility, brilliance, and love of life will truly be missed but never forgotten.
A celebration of Dr. Mann’s life will be held at the Carolina Inn in Chapel Hill. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made in honor of his legacy to one of the following organizations:
-To make a donation to the Department of Neurology at UNC so they can continue their battle to improve the lives of those with neurological diseases, including Parkinson’s:  J. Douglas Mann - UNC Neurology:
