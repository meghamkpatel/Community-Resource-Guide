Open House
(opens in new window/tab)
We invite prospective parents to an Open House on Sunday, January 7th, 2024 from 3-5pm (2800 Pickett Rd. Durham NC 27705)
MSD's Open House is a chance for prospective families to talk with teachers and explore the classrooms and playgrounds.

Current parents will be on hand during Open House to answer questions. We look forward to seeing you there!
Chalk for Justice
Montessori School of Durham's
Rainbow Club
invites you to our
Solidarity Week: Chalk for Justice
event on
Monday, November 13th from 3:15pm-4:30pm.
All children and grown ups are welcome to join us in creating and sharing artwork and messages of solidarity and justice along the MSD car line sidewalk. We will meet at the MSD Peace Pole (next to the Toddler & Early Childhood buildings) at 3:15pm and will start by singing songs of solidarity.
We are hosting this event in support of GLSEN's Solidarity Week 2023. Solidarity Week is a student-powered campaign dedicated to building collective support for LGBTQ+ students and educators. Our goal is to help our school's families learn about and practice solidarity across different and intersecting identities.
Solidarity work happens in many forms and on many different issues. The important part of understanding solidarity work is that collective action is powerful in enacting change. In fact, solidarity can either be the biggest threat to oppression or one of the biggest allies in upholding and reinforcing it.
Showing up (or not) makes all the difference.
