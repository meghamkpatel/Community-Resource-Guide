We at the Durham Tech Foundation look forward to being an agent of change in the important work ahead—helping expand job training and tools in growing industries through private support, cultivating strategic partnerships to address our community’s most pressing needs, and better resourcing Durham Tech to become a fully student-centered institution that ensures that all students develop the knowledge, skills, and networks needed to be successful.
Thank you for making our progress possible.
