ABOUT  SUBUD
Subud is an association of people from different religions, beliefs, nationalities and cultures. Its members experience a direct contact between themselves and the Great Life Force, or the power of God. This experience, which we call latihan kejiwaan, is received in the form of spontaneous movements or understandings that are unique for each person. It is not learned or taught, but is something natural, arising within us.
Many of our members are active in social, cultural and entrepreneurial activities that aim to benefit humankind.
