nature of my game
I'm glad there are no gods.  Otherwise, I'd have to choose.  Which god should I believe in?  Ah, I don't mean Allah or Mercury or whatever.  I mean within the Christian faith.  It's almost as bad as choosing a salad dressing in an American restaurant.  Which should I choose to assure me of an afterlife?
