Defeating Poverty by providing resources for the mind, body and soul
Neighbors in our community may become overwhelmed and need help rebuilding their lives to become productive and self-sufficient.
Every case is different.  Complete solutions may be complex and difficult to implement.
We draw on our many years of experience to assess each situation and provide the individual or family with a
"Path"
tailored to meet each set of circumstances.
We provide free services as well as working with other community agencies to provide the applicant with the tools and resources needed to embark upon their own
"Path to Defeat Poverty".
