F
or over 60 years, the Threshold has helped people reach their full potential, through guidance, caring support, education and opportunity. Today, we continue to provide these supports and in doing so, we are enriching peoples' lives!
Through our many programs, which are as varied as the over 600 people we serve annually, we believe in offering a “Continuum of Care” philosophy, providing dignified and respectful services to each person during every stage of their life.

The CDC has provided a new COVID-19 resource on their website!  This resource was developed by the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD) to provide individuals with low literacy and their caregivers information on how to stay safe during the pandemic. The virtual resource explains vaccinations, COVID-19 testing, handwashing, mask-wearing and social distancing through videos and visual storytelling.
