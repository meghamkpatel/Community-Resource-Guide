Aglow Mid-Atlantic Region Welcomes You
The Aglow Mid-Atlantic Region serves the areas of
Delmarva, District of Columbia, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia
Gwen Campbell, Mid-Atlantic Regional Director
We will
know the Word of God. We will pray with unwavering faith.
We will
walk in favor and full provision.
We will
be obedient warriors in the army of God.
We will
prevail, for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty in God to the pulling down of strongholds.
We will
break through barriers, go where we are not wanted, enter through new gates, build bridges of relationship and unity until we see His Kingdom come and His will done on Earth as it is in Heaven.
