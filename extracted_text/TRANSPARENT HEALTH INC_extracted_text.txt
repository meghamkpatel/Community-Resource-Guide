Learn More
There are lots of funders and investment firms that focus on bringing tech to market, but we focus entirely on healthcare. Why?
When typical tech startups come to healthcare and try to apply traditional tech solutions, some complex challenges immediately come to light:
While some firms shy away from healthcare startups, and others lack the unique knowledge required to bring a product to success, our group has the experience and know-how to analyze, improve and position new technology for acceptance and success in the medical field. Our team is made up entirely of experts in healthcare technology and information systems.
The industry is slow to adopt new tech.
Hospitals and healthcare systems are often running outdated versions of Windows and other software that are essential to their ongoing operations.
Many layers of regulation and management often separate technology decision makers and the doctors, nurses and other providers implementing and using the technology.
Rules regarding the protection of private health information bring complex requirements to new platforms.
ready to partner?
We're ready to explore opportunities to spin up companies who are gaining traction, but need preparation, consulting and investment to move forward. If you're a company ready to solve health care problems, we want to talk! If you're an investor looking for just that kind of company to invest in, partner with us!
