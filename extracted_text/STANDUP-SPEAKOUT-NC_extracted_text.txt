2024 Creating Youth Voices for Change
"Creating Youth Voices for Change," addresses the critical challenges  faced by today's youth, particularly those affected by trauma. Through  creative art-intervention sessions, we prevent negative consequences  associated with unaddressed trauma, such as mental health disorders and  academic struggles. By fostering resilience, our program empowers youth  to navigate emotions and build a healthier future.  Through our Art Heals model we create a safe, fun, and creative space to ignite the artist within.  Our goal is to equip youth the the tools they need to navigate life healthy and whole.
