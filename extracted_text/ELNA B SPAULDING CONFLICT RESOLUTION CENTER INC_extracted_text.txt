Here at the Elna B. Spaulding Conflict Resolution Center we utilize mediation, negotiation, and training to help people address conflict. We also use Restorative Justice models such as victim-offender mediation or dialogue and conferencing when appropriate. Our goal is to offer a variety of means to resolve and manage conflict and disputes by customizing the approach to meet our clients needs.
