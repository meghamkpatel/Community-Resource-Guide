About the Program
The American Association for Gifted Children (AAGC) was organized in 1976 in New York to focus on the Education of Gifted Children in America.  AAGC. moved to Duke University in 1989 to become the research arm of the Talent Identification Program, (TIP).  For the last 10 years AAGC has been part of the Duke Social Science Research Institute (SSRI).  In 2001, AACC collaborated with the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction to design and implement a Nurturing Program for K-2 students, funded by a grant from the United States Department of Education.
The funds were used to develop Project Bright IDEA, Interest Development Early Abilities, K-2 and to conduct the research in 28 schools in North Carolina. Additional grants provided funds to extend the program into other schools and to adapt the research to a new program, Wired for Learning.  Since 2013, Duke Students have been involved with the research to study the projects and to collect data from classrooms. See the Historical Perspective for detailed information about major events and Important work since 1976.
The AAGC Board of Directors voted to dissolve the original non-profit on May 22, 2023 and to move the assets to
