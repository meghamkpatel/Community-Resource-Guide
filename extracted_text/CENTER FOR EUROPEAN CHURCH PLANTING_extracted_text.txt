Advancing the Gospel in Europe.
Our Vision
Help plant a Christ-centered, Spirit-empowered church in every European nation by 2040.
CECP exists to advance the gospel in Europe by planting churches that reach lost people. Through strategic partnerships with church planters, missionaries, and local churches, we provide financial partnership and logistical support to make church planting effective.
We believe now is the time for Europe. We believe that Europe can and will be transformed through the gospel of Jesus Christ. We also believe that the most effective way to reach Europe is through church planting. When you support a CECP missionary, you can impact a continent for generations to come.
We Currently Serve in the Following Nations
United Kingdom
Historically a long-standing Christian nation, the United Kingdom has become increasingly secularised in recent decades. The Evangelical Church is virtually not growing in the UK - at the moment it stands at 0% growth per year.
There is often hostility towards religious expression; tolerance and diversity are strongly advocated instead.
Spain
There are only about 461,998 Evangelicals - about 1% of the population - in Spain. More than 7,500 towns with populations over five thousand have no Evangelical witness.
In a country where Catholicism was the state religion and is still given special governmental consideration, most of the growth in the number of Evangelicals since 1960 has occurred through immigration. There is a great need for negative perceptions of the Evangelical Church to be changed so that they can reach the Spanish people.
Russia
Of a population of 140 million, a mere 1.2% are Evangelicals. In the Moscow region, small churches only have 20 to 50 members on average, and 200 members is considered a large church.
The Church in Russia has a history of persecution. Although freedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitution, restrictions and discrimination can affect minority religions. The Orthodox Church still has a place of prominence and influence politically, and virtually all of the 67% of Russians who identify as Christian are Orthodox, although only 6-10% are active. The Orthodox Church is increasingly intolerant towards other expressions of Christian faith.
