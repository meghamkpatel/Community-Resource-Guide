We believe that the Bible is the INSPIRED Word of God. We believe that Jesus is the Son of God. We believe "it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God..." (Ephesians 2:8). We believe that we should strive to have a living, obedient, Biblical faith. We are glad to speak with you personally about other questions of faith and doctrine.
If you, a family member or a friend is interested in becoming a member of the Liberty City church Of Christ, please contact any of our members who will direct your request to our evangelism ministry leaders and our evangelist, Eric W. Doss.
