Welcome to House of Prayer Ministries
Church of God In Christ!
We are a Bible based ministry that believes in the full revelation of Jesus Christ as revealed in both the Old and New Testament.
Our mission is to reach the lost while helping believers to strengthen their resolve to love Jesus and to live a righteous and victorious life in this present world.
Isaiah 56:7
I will make them joyful in my house of prayer for my house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.
