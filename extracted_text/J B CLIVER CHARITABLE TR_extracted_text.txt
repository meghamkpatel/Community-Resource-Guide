In January 2015 I got a telephone call from my former secretary at Mills & Reeve. She explained to me that, outside work, she was a committee member of a charity, the Spade Hammer and Pen Society, and, in circumstances I could not really understand, they had had their building taken off them by a Mr Clive Brown, who was now pretending to be in charge of the charity and was using it to run his business.
The charity, Sandra explained, had lost all its papers when it lost the building, had no money but had started possession proceedings. However it also faced harassment proceedings from the faction led by Mr Brown, and felt they were tied up in legal red tape and getting nowhere. Out of loyalty to Sandra, I agreed to see the committee members to discuss the case in order to see whether there was anything I could do to help.
A few days later I had the pleasure of meeting five of the charity’s committee members arrived at my house in Bewdley, Worcestershire – along with several lever arch files of papers – and I can assure everyone it has turned out to be a real pleasure getting to know the committee members as part of a challenging legal case.
My new clients told me what had happened. There are times, as a lawyer, when the expression “truth is stranger than fiction” is an underestimate of what we deal with. The account of events I was told had to be true because it was so outrageous that nobody could have made up such a story. Lawyers are like police officers – we poke around in nooks and crannies of people’s affairs where those in respectable society would prefer not to go. The nooks and crannies in this case were somewhat dark and obscure.
The charity started as a friendly society and has deep roots in the West Indian community in the Erdington area of Birmingham. It had an active membership and provided social support to its long-standing members and others, many of whom were in their 70s and 80s.   This is a tight-knit, proud and supportive community.  Many founding members came over to Britain in the 50s and 60s and made their lives here. They have been the bedrock of the community in since they arrived. The present members include both the founding members and subsequent generations. They know and support each other – whatever the circumstances. The “Spade and Hammer” is part of the glue that held the community together – whether it was an afternoon gathering for the elderly members, an evening social for the younger members, celebrating Black History Month or supporting people across the Erdington community. They have strong links with their local MP and are not shy about promoting their issues. The Spade and Hammer is a key, strong part of our divergent multi-cultural society and should be celebrated – something some of the recent arrivals on the UK political scene don’t seem to understand or welcome.
Anyway, back to the story. In 1981 the members had clubbed together to buy a property. 202 Slade Road has 3 stories, is within a stone’s throw of spaghetti junction, surrounded by shops and became the centre of the Charity’s activities.
In March 2014, the committee was approached by a fellow West Indian, Mr Clive Washington Brown. He told the committee that he wanted to share the Charity’s building with the charity, so he could run his nightclub, Club Umoja, from the building because he needed a new home for his business. Mr Brown, who had no previous dealings with the charity, had recruited some former members to his cause but the terms of his proposal were long on rhetoric but the proposed benefits for the charity’s members were pretty vague – and certainly there was no rent on offer.
The committee discussed this somewhat unusual offer, and politely declined it. But, the charity soon found that Mr Brown was not a man to have his “proposal” declined. He reacted with fury and sent the charity a bill for £10,000 for having the affront to say no to his proposal. The lack of any legal basis for his invoice did not deter him. That was a pattern the charity would see repeated on many other occasions.
Mr Brown – a large man who cuts an imposing presence and has a superficially attractive way with words - then called together his supporters, and held a meeting at the Crown and Cushion Public House. Resolutions were carried at this informal meeting to sack the Charity’s committee and replace them with his team – and there are no prizes for guessing who was to become chair. The members of the committee who were being sacked were – of course – wholly unaware of this meeting.
Mr Brown’s first attempt to enforce these resolutions the following day resulted in an altercation at the club premises, leading to the police being called and various criminal charges being brought against Mr Brown.
However, undeterred by being ejected from the premises by the police, 2 weeks later his faction broke into 202 Slade Road, changed the locks and hence effectively ejected the committee from the charity’s own building.  However, to give a veneer of respectability to this heist, he also managed to gain access to the Charity Commission website and changed the names of the charity’s officers to him and his supporters. He also managed to transfer the liquor licence to his name and hence, it looked to the world as if there had been an orderly transfer under which control of the charity had passed from one committee to a new committee, with Mr Brown and co as the new officers.  But, in reality, there had been no AGM and no members vote to put the new committee in office, and the charity’s social activities came to a grinding halt.
To cement his new position, Mr Brown caused the charity to commence proceedings under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 against the properly elected members of the committee of the charity, alleging that they were harassing him and his supporters by attempting to re-enter the property and were stopping him running the charity.
The committee went in person to the Birmingham County Court and commenced possession proceedings. But they found it hard to make any progress in a series of initial hearings where both sides were claiming to represent the charity. I have no idea how the Judges reacted to the real committee – many of whom were elderly members of the Birmingham Afro-Caribbean community – saying they were the Spade, Hammer and Pen Society and a 6 foot 5 inch eloquent man saying “No”, he was the chair of the charity and waving around the Charity Commission database and his liquor licence to try to prove it.  Needless, to say the Charity remained locked out of its own premises as the status quo was maintained.  The charity did manage to seek advice from solicitors who told them that these were “charity proceedings” and so could not be litigated without the support of the Charity Commission who, at this stage, were sitting on their hands doing nothing.
This behaviour was similar to Mr Brown’s involvement with the Uplands Allotment Association where he had moved into a community society before and started trying to make money for himself out of the members. That ended up in court and Mr Brown lost, and so it seemed he had just moved on to his next target.
As I heard this convoluted story in January 2015, I realised that the legal issues in this case were far from straightforward and, if there was any chance of doing justice for the Charity, I needed the very best junior to support me. So a few days later I ambled along the corridor, put my head around the door of a young and talented member of Landmark Chambers, Sonal Barot, door and gently asked whether she would be prepared to join me in acting for the Charity. I was working on a direct access, conditional fee agreement where I would not receive any payment unless the charity was successful. It was not quite pro-bono but at that point it felt as near as made no difference. I was perfectly open with Sonal about the financial side of the case - the chances of either of us ever being paid anything for doing this case were somewhat remote, but the legal issues were fascinating and, as far as I could see, we had been approached by the good guys in this dispute.
Sonal had no hesitation in accepting this somewhat unattractive offer and despite the fact that she was not yet registered for direct access, she agreed to help. We then set to work to try to work out how to get this substantial property back for the Charity. Most legal cases fall into a fairly recognised pattern. This case was like nothing either of us had ever done before.
Now a confession - neither Sonal nor I hold ourselves out as experts in charity law. She knew more property law than me, but we could both spot a crook when needed and there seemed to be was a significant one at the centre of this. However, unravelling this mess was far from straightforward in part because the affairs of the charity had been run in a way in the same way as many small charities, namely somewhat informally and with much goodwill making up for a lack of proper government systems. All of the books and records of the charity were in the building and so the committee did not even have access to the primary documents to prove that they were the duly elected committee.
Sonal and I spent a number of evenings scratching our heads trying to work out the right way to put the case to regain possession of the building. It was a classic “joint effort”. Sonal was focused, had an attention to detail which was hugely impressive and had a burning sense of purpose in seeking to right this obvious wrong.  Eventually, we structured an argument based upon the Charity’s Constitution to advance a case that the meeting at the Crown and Cushion Public House cannot have been a lawful meeting of the charity (even if those who were present claimed to be members) because it had not been convened by the Committee of Management. Once the authority of that meeting was stripped away, we agued that these were not charity proceedings but a simple common law claim by a building owner to get property back. Even that was not straightforward as the charity was the beneficial but not legal owner of the building. The trustees were 3 elderly members – one present and supportive, one deceased and one long retired to Jamaica. But we plotted a course to seek to persuade a Judge that the committee should regain possession.
Sonal and I went to Birmingham to run this argument in front of Mr District Judge Salmon. I am not sure that either of us had ever experienced a court case quite like this. About 20 of our team turned up to support the committee; and a sizeable number of Mr Brown’s supporters were also present. We were moved to a series of larger court rooms to accommodate the crowds of supporters.
It was a hugely intimidating atmosphere but Sonal was superb. She formed an instant empathy with our clients, almost all of whom had no experience of civil proceedings and for whom the whole process was a mystery. We presented the case in a day long hearing and seemed to get our points across.
Tragically, by the date of judgment on 15 May 2015, Sonal was no longer with us. All of us have dark spaces in the mind which seem like a foreign country to each of us, let alone to anyone else. But there was far, far more to Sonal than the dark spaces and she took her own life.  However, thanks to her diligence, the Judge followed the course we had plotted out for him and a possession order was made in favour of the charity and possession of the building was recovered on 20 May 2015.
As barristers, we are acutely aware that we have enormous privilege. Unlike so many people in our society who are overworked and underpaid, we do fascinating work for which we are usually well paid. Sonal had many cases she could have taken up, but she had no hesitation whatsoever in agreeing to get involved in a complicated case that would take up an inordinate amount of her time with very little prospect of ever getting paid. I am not sure that she even gave it a second thought. Her approach was that the clients needed her help, had a good case - if only we could find the way to put it - and she was up for the challenge.
I am sure there are young people who become lawyers only for the financial rewards that our profession can bring. Sonal was not in that category. She was prepared to use her skills and expertise to benefit those who would pay her and those who were unable to do so.
The Spade, Hammer and Pen litigation has continued. Mr Brown did not take defeat lightly and, is now an undischarged bankrupt because he refused to pay the costs of the proceedings. He is still disputing the decisions of the Court. He has lost his appeal and so tried to sue me and the solicitor who I persuaded to assist me – Rosaleen Kilbane from the Community Law Partnership in Birmingham, and 7 members of the Birmingham judiciary. Those proceedings were struck out and he then served statutory demands on a number of people, including the Community Law Partnership and me - saying we owed him over £2M. Thanks to assistance from the Bar Mutual Indemnity Fund, those statutory demands were easily set aside. Mr Brown and one of his colleagues as well as company he has used are now the subject of an extended civil restraint order.
Mr Brown claimed to have no money, having put his property interests in trust for his children. Last week, HHJ Barker QC make an order vesting the property interests in his joint trustees in bankruptcy and so the Charity may, eventually, get some compensation for all the pain that he has put them through.
Perhaps the most important message is that the charity is now back in its building and is thriving.
I know I speak for every member of chambers and all the staff in saying that we miss Sonal greatly, but our loss of her as a colleague is nothing compared to her family’s loss of Sonal as a daughter, a sister and a partner. They can be assured that our memories of Sonal are not focused on her passing but on everything she added to so many of us during the too short time she was with us. The story of the Spade and Hammer case is typical of her selflessness, her commitment and her empathy with those in trouble. We greatly miss her and share your grief but in her short time with us she touched many lives – all in a positive way.

I'm reading some of Sonal's work in 2013/2014 and, as much as I like to think I'm good, her work is extraordinary in a dense, complex area. I decided to look her up, and I was sorry to hear she had passed. Thanks for the background David.
