Strengthening Parish Ministry for the Future.
The Episcopal Parish Network (EPN),
is an active network of parishes and cathedrals across the country and around the church. Our members vary in size from smaller congregations to our largest churches. EPN’s members are resourced with people, buildings, property, and money – allowing them space and capacity to dream of what comes next. For almost 40 years, EPN has seen its role as bringing innovative, agile, and transformational lay and clergy leaders together for conversations, peer-to-peer learning, and networking in order to strengthen parish ministry and serve our communities.

JOB BOARD
“You ask the question what’s in it for me?
You’ll only meet 700 amazing Christians who will transform and inspire your ministry for the rest of your life. Oh! I might try that.”
The Rev. Dr. Sam Wells, Vicar,
St. Martin-in-the-Fields, and 2023 Conference Keynote Speaker
“For parishes thinking about becoming an EPN member, I say give it a try! Take it to your vestry and show them how it can change your ministry. It’s changing mine.”
The Rev. Tommy Thompson, Rector,
Washington Memorial Chapel: The Episcopal Church at Valley Forge
“EPN membership helps us talk to other people from other parishes who are struggling with the same things. … great pollination of what’s going on in the Episcopal Church and a renewal being with other Episcopalians.”
Ms. Rosie Thompson, Sponsor,
Watts and Co., London (UK)
“There is a richness of resources available as an EPN member. I can’t imagine there is a congregation out there, regardless of size and financial position, that couldn’t benefit from being in community with members of this organization.”
The Very Rev. Kate Moorhead Carrol, Dean,
St. John’s Cathedral, Jacksonville, FL
“I’m slightly worried about where the church is going … but EPN is helping me stay informed about the future and how to navigate it.”
The Rev. Elizabeth Ivell, Associate Rector,
St. Peter’s Episcopal Church, Morristown, NJ
