Empowerment through employment
​DECI's mission is to help people with vocational disabilities achieve a sense of self-worth by optimizing their potential to earn their own wages through work.
​
DECI is a private, nonprofit community-based rehabilitation program in Durham County, North Carolina, serving adults with disabilities.  A self-supporting industry, DECI provides superior services to commercial customers.  Many customers are located in or near the Research Triangle Park but our services extend nationally and internationally.  The revenues earned by DECI’s commercial services provide a host of job training and job placement for adults with disabilities, giving these individuals the opportunity to work either at DECI or in the community.
DECI has been ISO 9001 certified for over 15 years.  Our commitment to the standard ensures our production, warehousing, and distribution services are top quality and continually improving to meet the demands of our changing world.
​DECI is CARF accredited. Our overall goal is to provide top quality service programs that enable people with disabilities​, and CARF accreditation demonstrates DECI's
commitment to continually improving our services and serving our community.
