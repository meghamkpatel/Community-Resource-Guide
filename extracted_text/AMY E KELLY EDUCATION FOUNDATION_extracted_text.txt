Founding, Vision and Mission
Our Founding, Vision and Mission
Several years ago, our current directors created the Amy E. Kelly Education Foundation to give every interested person the opportunity to support post-secondary education.  We help launch recent high school graduates by providing one-time scholarships, thus enabling our young people to become permanent, contributing members of our community.
The Amy E. Kelly Education Foundation is reaching back in our community to fund the dream of educational success that will change our world.
The Amy E. Kelly Education Foundation reflects the primary values of its namesake: maintaining a positive attitude and believing in one’s ability to accomplish anything in life.  We emphasize education, truth, hard work and courage to ensure that no deserving scholar be deprived of higher education.
