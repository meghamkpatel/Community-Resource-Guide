The Power of Mentorship, Curiosity and Kindness: Remembering our Friend, Brian Jolin
Jul 15, 2022
On July 6, 2022 we lost a valued member of our PromoKitchen family. Brian was one of our most vocal and dedicated supporters. He was a force of nature in getting us volunteers, being a dedicated mentor and constantly pushing us to do more and to do better for our DEI work. He constantly aimed to "shine light into dark places and fight injustices."
We're sharing a tribute to Brian from our past president Robert Fiveash who mentored Brian for years and brought him even more into the fold of PK. As anyone who has been through our mentorship program knows that you don't leave the same person. You make friendships for life.
Brian's spirit and sense of humor will be greatly missed by our community. From his constant support, to his "I was just thinking" emails, to his famous Christmas cards, Brian's absence will be felt. So go out, make a difference, make someone feel special and make big changes in this world.
