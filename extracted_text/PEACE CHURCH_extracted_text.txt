GIVING
Giving is foundational to the Christian life. God calls us to be holy in every corner of our lives, and financial giving is the first step to being holy and faithful with our income. It is how Christians put God and his Church first in their faithful stewardship of finances.

At Peace Church, we are excited to have the opportunity to share the gospel with kids.
On Sunday mornings, Peace offers programming for ages birth through 3
rd
grade. Your kids will spend the hour worshipping, engaging in a lesson from the Bible, and having a chance to participate in activities that are age appropriate and reinforce the lessons they have learned.
Click here to learn more about what to expect on Sunday mornings.
Families are also welcome to join us in service. We have a Family Room at the back of the Worship Center if you need to step out with your toddler or infant. Downstairs in the Venue we offer a live-streamed service. In the Venue we have a little something for everyone in the family from snacks and coffee to coloring activities and toys.
Our congregation is made up of a variety of people from the West Michigan area, and that brings with it a variety of clothing styles, from dress shirts and ties to jeans and a t-shirt. There is no need to be worried about fitting in, Peace Church is home to all kinds of different people.
No matter how you are dressed, we welcome all to join us for worship of Jesus Christ and be a part of the incredible things God is doing here.
At Peace Church we are Gospel-Centered, Family-Focused, and Kingdom-Minded. Our mission is to see the Gospel embraced and passed on for generations of Kingdom impact.
The gospel is the good news that although we have sinned and fallen short of God’s perfect standard (Rom 3:23) and therefore deserve eternal death (Rom 6:23), God sent his only Son Jesus Christ to live the perfect life we couldn’t live, die the death for sin we deserved to die, and rise to life so that by faith we can have eternal life with him (John 3:16).
