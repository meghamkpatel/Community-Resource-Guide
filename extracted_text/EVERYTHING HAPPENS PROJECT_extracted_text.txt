Meet Kate
Hi, I’m Kate. I’m a Duke professor, podcaster, and author with a single mission: giving you permission to feel human. After years of being told I was incurable, I was declared cancer-free. But there’s no going back. I am forever changed by what I discovered:
life is so beautiful and life is so hard. For everyone.

Everything Happens.
Are you living your best life now? Not always? This is a podcast for you. Duke Professor Kate Bowler is an expert in the stories we tell about success and failure, suffering and happiness. She had Stage IV cancer. Then she didn’t. And since then, all she wants to do is talk to funny and wise people about how to live with the knowledge that, well,
everything
happens.

The Everything Happens Initiative is a project dedicated to storytelling, research, and spiritual formation.
Our mission is simple: we seek to bear Christian witness to the fragility of life. Even in the midst of a global pandemic, our culture is inundated with self-help mythologies and quasi-religious “solutions” to the problem of suffering. These individualistic, often anti-institutional, narratives promise an escape from the basic problems of being human: our precarity, our losses, our fear that our lives cannot be “fixed.” This project is devoted to developing language and fostering a digital community around kindness, courage and compassion in a world that loves us more when we are good, better, best.
GROUNDING SPIRITUAL VIRTUES
We seek to render beautiful and intelligible the following virtues distilled into the wider culture through the efforts of this Initiative:
Kindness
Kindness is a love enacted purely for the good of others, preserving their dignity with quiet strength, under the rubric of an unspoken permission to be human and as yet unperfected. We seek to be lavish in our kindness, knowing that it will be mistaken for weakness.
hope
Our hope will be easily confused with optimism and positive thinking, but we remain stubborn in our resolve to be absurdly hopeful. We believe that hope is the sure sense of having tasted the goodness and love of God. We also believe that hope is an anchor dropped into the future, part of an unimaginably beautiful yet unseen future ordained and ushered in through Jesus’s saving work.
courage
Courage is the decision to take heart. Even after a long look at reality, courage prompts us to action or to endurance, holding to the core of a God-given vision or a principle or purpose. Courage protects our soft hearts from encroaching or eroding forces, showing us how to press into God’s purposes even if it isn’t in our self-interest.
HUMILITY
Humility teaches us how to render love into service. It is the gift of learning to hear from God about how we might act for our neighbor’s good. Humility teaches us how to stand at the door and welcome those God has brought. Humility asks us to move against the grain of capitalism’s hyper instrumentalization, commodification, and utilitarianism in favor of what work—fast or slow—God might be up to.
Gracious Sponsors
We are grateful to have the strong support of wonderful partners who are aligned in their priorities and their vision for this project.
Every week I usually forget most of the basics:
a) you are loved. b) life is absurd. c) it’s hard to be a human.
If you want some smart, kind, and funny encouragement to get you through your week, sign up for my newsletter. I’d love to be your reminder.

My best friend Chelsea knows that I have an absurdly high need for extremely random things to happen to me. So she took me to a restaurant with white linens and white plates and only a spotlight over the plate and then GUESS WHAT?!
IT WAS AN ANIMATED DINNER.
It was that or she was going to take me to watch the garter snakes mate in a quarry two hours north of Winnipeg. So…I’m fine with this choice.
(Then she made them celebrate “Have a Beautiful Terrible Day!” becoming a bestseller and it was our understanding that many people would have many special events…but they did not. So she made 30 people sing VERY LOUDLY only for me.)
Here’s to randomness and friends of all kinds.
Any random things on the docket for you? Snakes are mating people!

a blessing for Mother`s Day
Bless all the moms—
those who have carried us
in their bodies,
and in their hearts,
and in their minds,
and all those who have mothered us
in some form or fashion.
The ones who answer our calls
no matter the time of day,
or absurd the request.
Those who remind us
that we are loved, loved, loved
no matter what.
We thank them and honor them all.
Those we can hug today,
and those who are now gone
and those now distant from us.
And bless all those too
for whom mothering is
complicated, difficult,
heartbreaking, or incomplete.
Do what only you can do, God:
Bless and heal.
Restore. Rebuild.
Pour love over everything
these hearts have touched.

Thank you @DukeUniversity for this ridiculousness. Congratulations on your 100th birthday. You don’t look a day over 65.
P.S. I will never be happy again unless someone gives me a banner (or card or even piece of paper) that is at least 9 feet tall.

She bird-by-birded it, folks. @AnneLamott has written another gorgeous winner called “Somehow.” Three cheers for the author of inspiration, self-deprecation, and more than a million good reasons to be hopeful.
“Love abounds and abides, flirts and weeps with us. It is there for the asking—which is the easy part. Our life’s toughest work is in the receiving.” —Anne Lamott
Is it easier for you to give love or receive it? (And if you’re a receiver, TEACH US YOUR WAYS.

Mother’s Day might bring up a lot. If this is a heavy week, I am sending you ALL the love. Every bit.
@MinkaKelly shares her own story of resilience, love, and forgiveness under pressure. Raised by a single mom who struggled with addiction, Minka had to learn how to take care of herself and the adults around her, and, eventually, to forgive her mom. This is one of my absolute favorite conversations about love that is never perfect. But rings through our hearts.

Things didn’t turn out the way we hoped they would… so now what?
I’m grateful for the way Dr. Don Rosenstein and Dr. Justin Yopp open up new language and permission for those in the middle of loss. They have dedicated their careers to the hard, hard work of re-imagining new futures and facilitating places for those who have lost too much to put each other back together again. (Despite the fact that they work at UNC 😆)
Listen to our full conversation through the link in my bio to hear an update about the ways they are continuing their exceptional, thoughtful work since our original conversation in 2020.

If you are reading this you have great eyesight. But also, thanks for being a person with me. The world is strange and hard for soft-hearted humans, but I think you’re a delight.
