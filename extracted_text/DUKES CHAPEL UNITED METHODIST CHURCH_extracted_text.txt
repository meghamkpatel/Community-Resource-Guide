Welcome
Welcome to Duke's Chapel UMC!  At Duke's Chapel, we strive to exhibit the love of Jesus Christ for all persons, both inside and outside of our community.  We believe that Christ is present and active in the whole of life, not just on Sunday mornings.  Therefore, it is our mission to share this good news and make disciples of Jesus Christ for the transformation of the world.  We, at Duke's Chapel, invite you to come share in our journey!
Gathering Times
Worship - Sundays, 10:00 am
Sunday School - following worship
History
Duke's Chapel, originally called Mount Hebron, began at a brush-arbor meeting place near the plantation of William J. Duke, its founder. When a $100 30' x 35' log church was built, Washington Duke, William's younger brother, said, "That's a heap of money to put into religion." Our church has grown from a log building in 1842 to a lovely stone edifice in 1927 to a spacious addition for education fellowship in 1968. We are challenged by our remarkable history to fulfill God's calling on our congregation to become messengers of the Kingdom of God. To you who worship here, we extend the challenge to join us in ministry. We are glad you are here!
