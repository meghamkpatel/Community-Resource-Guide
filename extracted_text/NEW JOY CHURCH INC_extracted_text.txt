News from Pastor Chris
On the Ministry Blog,Â  you will find church news along with posts from Pastor Chris Duckworth covering wide-ranging topics about faith and life.
The Truth is...
that we donât always believe confidently, or pray wholeheartedly, or serve selflessly on our own. Yet, when we come together in community we draw out the best in each other and in ourselves, lean on the faith of our sisters and brothers, and seek the goodness of God for ourselves and for the world that God so loves.
Full of belief or doubt, confidence or questions? There is a place for you at New Joy. The people of New Joy are newcomers to Christianity and interfaith families, lifelong active church goers and people who have spent decades away from the church before finding their way to New Joy. There is a place for you at New Joy, too.
New Joy was established just in 2002. As a congregation weâre still growing up. You might say weâre in our awkward adolescence. We havenât figured everything out. Weâre having fun as we grow and as we see what God is putting before us. We hope youâll be part of our future.
At New Joy, we are focused on...
Growing Deeper
Worship flows into the home with weekly at-home devotions connected to Sundayâs Scripture and sermon. Youth group, menâs and womenâs groups, book groups and service projects lead us to grow deeper in our trust in Godâs promises.
Reaching Wider
With services opportunities almost weekly at New Joy, and projects each month, New Joy is committed to helping you serve your neighbor in the way of Jesus. Not a member of New Joy, but want to serve in the community? Check out how we serve and join in the work of blessing others with acts of compassion and care.
