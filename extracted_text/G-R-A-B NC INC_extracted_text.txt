â€‹GRAB CREED
I will forever GRAB life!
I will GRIND hard in everything I do.
I will REACH all goals and
ACHIEVE them with integrity.
I will BALL out and turn to help those in my path.
I will forever GRAB life.
â€‹GRINDING
â€‹G represents GRINDING. Grinding in the urban dictionary means someone who works hard, someone who finds a way to make it happen. One we would like to call a "Go Getter".
â€‹REACHING
â€‹R represents REACHING. Reaching for the essentials of life that will turn DREAMS into reality. To REACH, we must have something to GRAB for with understanding that REACHING is not always easy but with INTEGRITY, is achievable with available support.
â€‹ACHIEVING
â€‹A represents ACHIEVING. Achieving goals by gaining the desire to reach accomplishments. Giving HOPE all while making DREAMS come true.
â€‹BALLING
â€‹B represents BALLING. Balling is the means to have a great deal of wealth. Balling is the REWARD for the dedication and hard-work put in.
â€‹GRAB
Mission
â€‹Our mission is to meet our kids and families where they are and enable them to unlock their full potential, while providing life skills and enrichment and developmental programs to enhance day to day living with a pathway to their desired success.
GRAB
Vision
â€‹Our vision is to break the cycle of generational poverty and systemic racism by working in underprivileged communities with youth who are at risk for poor education, health and life decision outcomes by providing like skills training, college and career preparation counseling, and health education through a volunteer team of professionals with education and health experience. Improving outcomes for just one child can be the perfect beacon for other children to follow.
