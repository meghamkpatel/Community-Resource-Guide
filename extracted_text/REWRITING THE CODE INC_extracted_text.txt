We power the pursuit of your goals
Rewriting the Code is the largest peer-to-peer network of women in tech, providing support, mentorship, and education that helps pave the way for sustainable careers, professional advancement, and equal opportunities.
Community
In an industry where we’re the underrepresented gender, Rewriting the Code creates a community where, instead, we’re part of a family of like-minded women. Here we support each other’s unique ambitions by sharing ideas, insights, and real-world experiences.
Mentorship
Navigate your education and career with support from women who’ve been where you are. Our mentors represent a broad network of company tech leaders and peers.
Access
We’re dedicated to correcting inequity in the tech industry. Our accessible memberships are the first step to more equitable workplaces.
Education
Earning your degree in a male-dominated field is a unique challenge. We offer guidance, support and community on every step of your path to graduation.
How RTC supports college women
We’re here to help you navigate potential career paths, expose you to different tech disciplines, and support you as you develop your skills and seek internship opportunities.
How RTC boosts your early career
As you enter the workforce, we make sure you always have a community to fall back on: with a group of supportive women to help you navigate whatever your next step looks like.
