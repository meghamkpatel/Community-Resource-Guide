Durham Revival Worship Center - Community of Faith Ministry
Welcome to Durham Revival
            Worship Center (D.R.W.C.)
We thank you for visiting our website
and
        we hope and pray this is not by accident, but a divine connection of
        GOD. DRWC is
        a family
            oriented
            church whereby every family is highly valued no matter the history
            or the background. As God began a first family in the Garden of Eden,
            we strongly believe that
GOD has strategically positioned DRWC as
            an Eden Church of this time to carry on the mind that God had at
            the beginning
            to provide life to the current and future families. This
            is the reason, the devil has never liked the existence of families
            and that’s
          why he has waged war against families, but with GOD we will prevail.
Welcome with all your family members and we love you.
Rev. DAVID WAMBUA
Senior Pastor
