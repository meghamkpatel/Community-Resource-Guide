Spiritual growth often happens in our darkest moments. Human Kindness Foundation gives people experiencing incarceration simple tools to deepen spiritual practices and promote wellbeing.
The people we work with have taught us that freedom, peace and beauty are present even in the darkest places. We believe unconditional love and unquestioning inclusion can help people become the best version of themselves.
Relationships are the heart of our work. We build relationships with the wide network of people affected by the criminal legal system, particularly those who are currently or have previously experienced incarceration and their families and prison and jail staff and volunteers.
Real People, Real Stories
I had such dark thoughts. When I’d be mad at someone, I’d imagine… well… it’s bad. Now I imagine going to their house while they’re at work, and I plant a flower bed for them. I’ve gone to the library to look up what kinds of flowers to use, and I have the borders planned, and what colors I’ll plant together. I’m not even mad anymore. I want to bring beauty into their lives.  – Bud
We’re All Doing Time changed my life. When I first read it, I was in and out of solitary confinement. Now it’s been a 100 degree transformation. This service has brought me a freedom I’d never known and an energy of reconciliation with my loved ones. My experiences have built upon me the motivation to be part of the healing process for others. – Justin, USP McCreary
I don’t think I would have been able to find a belief in God had it not been for the meditation guide in Bo’s book. As my relationship with self and God has morphed it always comes back to the experience of meditating focusing on my heart chakra and the feeling as if my heart was the size of a thimble and a waterfall was being poured into it. Thus my first true evidence of God. – Anonymous
