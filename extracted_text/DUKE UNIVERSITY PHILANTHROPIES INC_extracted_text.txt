Giving to –
the next generation
of outrageous ambition
Because We Are Forever Duke
Every gift to Duke – large or small – plays a role in pushing us forward. They allow research into uncovering the next impossible discovery, financial aid ensuring the best and brightest always have a spot, and top faculty to train future leaders and advance new fields. In other words, Duke isn’t Duke without you.
Duke Isn’t Duke
Without You
Thanks to financial aid, all students are
afforded the opportunity
to pursue their greatest ambitions and benefit from the Duke experience.

Student Experience
We believe that education is both inside and out of the classroom, from studying in Lilly Library to cheering in Cameron Indoor Stadium. That’s why we’ve integrated service-learning, community engagement and studying away into the fabric of the Duke experience. Your support of programs like DukeEngage and Bass Connections allows students to apply what they’ve learned in the classroom to the real-world while shaping their learning, future careers and lives.

Research
Our research not only discovers answers to some of the world’s most pressing challenges – it changes lives for the better. Your gifts help us to strip away the divisions between departments, so that ideas flourish at the intersection of health, science, technology and the humanities. Faculty and work side by side with graduates and undergraduates, amplifying new voices and preparing students to confront the challenges of the future.

Faculty Support
Duke faculty is the best of the best. They not only make a difference through their research and scholarship to advance new fields, but in the students they train and mentor as future leaders. Answers to complex problems require multiple and inclusive perspectives, and your support helps to recruit and retain the next generation of diverse and superb faculty that make that possible.

Financial Aid
Our admissions are need-blind, so that the best and brightest always have a place at Duke regardless of their ability to pay. Your support of scholarships and fellowships ensures a student body of diverse perspectives, backgrounds and talents that enrich the classroom and campus experience.

Duke Health
Duke Health is at the forefront of the future of health care, translating discoveries into treatments that improve all our lives. Your support helps students and researchers work together to unlock the secrets of disease, fight the battle against urgent health challenges like COVID-19, make a difference in the health of both North Carolina and communities around the world, and offer a transformative education to prepare the next generation of great health care professionals.

Campus transformation
Duke’s campus is timeless, but we constantly strive to elevate it into a class of its own. We tear down divisional boundaries and establish collision spaces for innovative research across departments, such as humanities and medicine or computer science and philosophy. We create space inside and out of the classroom that enhance the way students live, learn and grow. Your support allows us to continue providing the highest level of academic life and patient care for a vibrant, diverse and exceptional campus community.
