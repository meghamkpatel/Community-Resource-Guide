Read Seed Inc on the Move for Literacy
Reading Books Make the Difference
Benefits of Reading to Children
The vast database of child literacy research throughout the world point to early childhood literacy and reading to children as fundamental to their academic success. Teaching your children to acquire
a love for reading
is one of the best lifelong gifts a parent and bestow on them.
​
A hundred years of research consistently attest to the fact that
reading with them sows many positive seeds. Parental bonding and 'just us' time together, for one. This reaches generation parenting models.  You open the world to them from home. Babies and young children who handle books and attempt to turn the pages develop motor skills earlier.
A study at a Rhode Island Hospital compared two groups of eight months old children. One group was read to often as babies, while the other group was not.  It was revealed that children who were read to had “receptive” vocabularies, the number of words they understand. Their vocabularies increased 40 percent since babyhood compared to the non-reading group increased by only 16 percent.
