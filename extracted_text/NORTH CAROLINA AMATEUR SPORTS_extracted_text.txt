About North Carolina Amateur Sports
North Carolina Amateur Sports (NCAS) is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization established in 1983 to host the first sanctioned State Games of North Carolina in 1986 and the U.S. Olympic Festival-’87. Today, it operates with the goal of promoting health and wellness for all ages and skill levels through organizing best-in-class sporting events that enrich the quality of life and enhance economic well-being of North Carolina communities.  NCAS hosts the BODYARMOR State Games of North Carolina, Cycle North Carolina “Mountains to the Coast” Bicycle Tour, Cycle North Carolina Coastal Ride and Cycle North Carolina Mountain Ride. Staffed by three permanent, full-time employees, NCAS has a 13-member Board of Directors.  NCAS’ success is attributed to the hundreds of volunteers who support the State Games and Cycle North Carolina. NCAS receives financial support from corporate sponsors, individual donors and event revenues.
