Our Mission
Y-Apply is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization dedicated to educating high-achieving public school students
from diverse
backgrounds and their families about financial aid options
and
the application process to top-tier colleges and universities.﻿﻿
Our Impact
Y-Apply has helped students and families negotiate
over $46M
in financial
aid packages
to highly selective colleges and universities since its inception. We have also had
a 98% success rate
of our students gaining admission to top-tier
colleges
and universities across the country.
Our Distinction
Y-Apply is the only national college access program that includes both students and families
as an integral part of its program model.
Students and families consistently credit Y-Apply
as playing
a key factor
in
gaining admission to a highly selective college or university.
Our Vision
When highly qualified students from underrepresented ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds are
applying and being accepted
to the
nation's best colleges and universities
at a
rate
comparable
to their counterparts, the
work of Y-Apply will be complete.
