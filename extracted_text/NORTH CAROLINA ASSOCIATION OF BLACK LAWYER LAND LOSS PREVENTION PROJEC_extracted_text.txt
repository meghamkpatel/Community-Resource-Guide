LAND LOSS PREVENTION PROJECT SUPPORT
We are an Organization Dedicated to the Preservation of Land Ownership
OUR MISSION
The Land Loss Prevention Project was founded in 1982 by the North Carolina Association of Black Lawyers to curtail epidemic losses of Black owned land in North Carolina. Land Loss Prevention Project was incorporated in the state of North Carolina in 1983. The organization broadened its mission in 1993 to provide legal support and assistance to all financially distressed and limited resource farmers and landowners in North Carolina.
Land Loss Prevention Project’s advocacy for financially distressed and limited resource farmers involves action in three separate arenas: litigation, public policy, and promoting sustainable agriculture and environment.
Activity in the litigation arena typically involves debt restructuring for farmers in crisis and other legal work. On the public policy front, Land Loss Prevention Project monitors agricultural policy and the impact it has on North Carolina’s small family farmers. Finally, Land Loss Prevention Project helps family farmers and landowners develop sustainable agricultural practices that are environmentally friendly and economically viable for their rural communities. Land Loss Prevention Project is committed to working alongside state, regional and national coalitions who support sustainable agriculture practices, development and policy innovations.
It is part of Land Loss Prevention Project’s organizational strategy to integrate policy and programmatic work into the issue areas addressed in litigation.
Learn About Our
SmartGrowth
Business Center
Farmers and their families face challenges every day which can affect their livelihood and the health of their business. SmartGrowth is focused on promoting solid business practices and using the law to assist you in securing your investment.
SmartGrowth is a resource within the Land Loss Prevention Project dedicated to assisting farmers who desire to gain or expand their business expertise. Farming is a competitive enterprise. Knowledge is a key component of success. Like the greater law firm of which we are a part, we concentrate on partnering with individuals who are not candidates for traditionally priced law firms but still expect superior service.
SmartGrowth provides consultation and legal assistance on business issues to farmers and people considering entering farming as a profession. How do I best protect my investment? Is forming a cooperative a good option for me? What should I look for in a contract? How do I get started? SmartGrowth can address such questions and, when appropriate, assist in negotiations. Curious about tax implications or the ins and outs of money management? We are building a network of professionals who have financial expertise.
