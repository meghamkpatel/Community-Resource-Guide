PCS IRIS Consultants have more than 300 years combined experience in Self-Directed Services (SDS). PCS was instrumental in the construction, development and refinement of Dane County’s SDS system. Current PCS staff are well trained on various styles of Person Centered Planning, assisting people in developing their outcomes, and
Asset-Based Community Development (ABCD)
which has successfully used this concept to assist participants in developing creative plans that have resulted in people achieving their outcomes.
