WELCOMING YOU WITH OPEN ARMS
Thanks for visiting our website and allowing us to share with you the ministry of Covenant Church International. In developing this site it was our desire to provide you with a user-friendly site that gives you pertinent information regarding who we are and what God is doing here at Covenant Church International. We have a slogan at Covenant Church International that says when you visit us you will “Hear The Radical And Experience The Change.”
It is our desire that for you that process will begin as you visit this site and come full circle when you visit our church and experience a live worship celebration with us. From the moment you pull into the parking lot, you’ll be made to feel at home. Our amazing greeter’s team will be poised and ready to give you direction and answer any questions you may have. As you enter the worship center, our ushers will welcome you and direct you to your seat.
The unique thing about our services is that we are committed to a creative, compelling, and challenging presentation of God’s word in a way that speaks to today’s culture. Our commitment is to communicate the Word in an uncompromising manner and also in a language that unchurched and non-religious can understand. The objective is to teach people how to apply the Word of God to their everyday life. Why not consider visiting us soon and experience it for yourself. Our promise is that “You Will Never Be The Same.”
Dr. P. Ronald Wilder

ONLINE GIVING
Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. And thereby put me to the test, says the Lord of hosts, if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need.
(Mal. 3:10–12)
