About Us
Who is Pastor Steve?
Pastor Stephen F. Dangerfield was called to the gospel ministry of preaching and was licensed by the congregation of Canaan Baptist Church under Reverend Dr. Derick Brennan, Senior Pastor in October of 2009. He served at Canaan Baptist Church in many capacities from 2009- 2020. He served as men’s bible study instructor which started with three men and grew to over sixty men. He also was an instructor for teen ministry, instrumental in teaching evangelism, visiting nursing homes, going to Chosen 300 to feed the homeless, and teaching at Canaan Institute. Pastor Dangerfield was also Pastor Brennan’s armor bearer.
In February 2014, Pastor Dangerfield went to Berean Baptist Church to serve the body of Christ under Senior Pastor, Reverend Dr. James Henry Buck II. He served at Berean from 2014-2017. Pastor Dangerfield is a missionary serving the people in Uganda on mission’s trips 2019-2020.
Pastor Dangerfield has preached and taught in many states and countries. Pastor Dangerfield’s purpose in life is to be used by the Lord to teach and to exhort people to the doorstep of salvation which is Jesus Christ.  One of Pastor Dangerfield’s favorite scriptures is Matthew 6:34 “When Jesus went ashore, He saw a large crowd, and He felt compassion for them because they were like."
