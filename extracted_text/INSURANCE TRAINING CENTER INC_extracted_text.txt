Very informative in simple terms!
I found the Ransomware and Insurance 2022 Market Update to be very informative and delivered in simple terms. It will be beneficial to make it available in other languages like Spanish. Perhaps this can be done using a closed caption option.

David Marsh, Partner, Broker
Most insurance courses are either pitched at people learning about the subject for the first time or jump straight into advanced topics. The ITC courses do a great job for all learners and I particularly liked the online format since you can either spend time starting from the beginning or quickly move on to the areas of most interest to you. The course material also went beyond insurance policy language – addressing risk management, claims processes, what buyers should consider, and more.

Rob H., SVP, Broker
This Commercial Crime course is fantastic. The content is very easy to follow and the visuals/graphics really helped simplify what is a very commonly misunderstood insurance product. I would certainly recommend this to anybody wishing to learn more about Crime insurance and the key risk exposures that businesses should be aware of.
