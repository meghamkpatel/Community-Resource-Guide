Go Conscious Earth empowers forest-dependent communities to protect their Congo Basin Rainforest, preserve endangered species, including endemic bonobos, and support global climate stability.
Our Approach
Rainforest Protection
Community Forestry
Endangered Species Conservation
Clean Water
Sustainable Livelihoods
Carbon Sequestration & Climate
We envision a vibrant Congo Basin Rainforest, its people and diversity of life flourishing, and earth’s climate stabilized.
It is Possible to Change the World
Go Conscious Earth
started out by boldly securing one million acres of rainforest in the “second lung of Mother Earth”, the Congo River Basin.
Our success not only protected the health of the forest, wildlife and people, but also proved that  community-based rainforest conservation was possible.
Be bold. And together, we can change the world.
“Forest conservation, sustainable development, and wildlife protection are inextricably linked. We must focus on helping local people with alternatives to cutting forests and poaching animals. Anti-poverty programs must include protection of legal land rights. Doing one without the other is, at best, not very efficient. At worst, it's doomed to fail.”
— Godi Godar, Go Conscious Earth Founder & Member of the
Ntomba Community
Join us to protect this vital place our whole planet depends on!
To conserve rainforest, Go Conscious Earth is committed to:
protection of ancestral land rights for Bantu and aboriginal   Batwa (Pygmy) people
fuel efficient cookstove production and distribution
women’s income generation initiatives
increased yields in sustainable farming and fishing
restoration of Lake Tumba ecology
family planning programs
establishment of non-timber forest products
establishment of fruit tree nurseries for food and income
establishment of woodlots for renewable cooking fuel; and,
employment of ethical eco-guards, especially in areas inhabited by endangered wildlife such as bonobos and forest elephants.
