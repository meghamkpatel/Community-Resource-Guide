15TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION
On October 29th, Nourish celebrated its 15th anniversary! Some of our students, alumni, donors, and board members gathered in the Nourish hometown of Chapel-Hill, North Carolina to honor our accomplishments from over the years. We awarded some of our most crucial Nourish donors, Clay and Neva Whybark, our board member Tommy Thekkendam, as well as our founder Dr. Sindhura Citineni. Here are some highlights from the event!
NOURISH 15 TO WATCH
In honor of 15 years of Nourish International, we have chosen 15 different students and alumni to highlight. Join us in celebrating their hardwork and dedication to both Nourish and their current or future career achievements!

GET INVOLVED
“Nourish has given me the opportunity to develop my leadership and communication skills in a whole new light. ​Before Nourish, I would never have imagined myself being able to lead and support such a diverse, passionate group of students as I do now. I also find myself so much more receptive and understanding of new ideas and perspectives. ​
Nourish provides me the opportunity to both develop myself personally while simultaneously leading and supporting others to do the same;
all with the common goal of bringing significant social change to our local community. You can’t find this sort of opportunity anywhere else!”​​
