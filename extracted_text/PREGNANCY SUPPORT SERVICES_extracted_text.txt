You matter.
At Pregnancy Support Services we offer a safe, non-judgmental space where you can verify your pregnancy with a medical professional and then learn about
your choices
. We want to empower you to make an informed decision! We also offer
case management services
if you need material resources or referrals to other community agencies in the Durham and Chapel Hill area for help with housing, food subsidies, childcare, or employment.
You do not have to do this alone. All you have to do it take the first step.
“I want to say. I appreciate all the support you have done for me. I will never forget it.  Thank you for letting me know that someone out there loves and supports me through this journey.”
