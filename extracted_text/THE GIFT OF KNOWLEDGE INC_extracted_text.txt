Register your child for the North Carolina Opportunity Scholarship
If you are considering sending your child to this or another private school, you can apply for the NC Opportunity Scholarship which provides from $3000 - $7000 for children to attend a nonpublic school.
Families of all income levels are able to apply.
For the families who receive the full Tier 1 or Tier 2 award, we cover the additional tuition costs through our fundraisers and grants so that they do not have to pay anything to receive a quality education for their child. Other school scholarships may be available for parents who do not receive these awards.
Priority enrollment is Feb 1 - March 1!
