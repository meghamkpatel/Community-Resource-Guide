THE MISSION
NorthStar Church of the Arts is a multidisciplinary artist led 501(c)3 nonprofit organization. Our mission is to harness the transformative power of art for social change, with a steadfast commitment to centering creative spiritual expression and fostering deep healing for artists of color. Housed in a historic church originally designed for the deaf community, our organization is a sanctuary for marginalized creatives. NorthStar stands as an illuminating nexus that expands its historical roots, providing holistic material support for artists and cultivating a safe haven for cross-cultural collaboration and community engagement.
In the face of rapid gentrification, we are dedicated to ensuring that Black, working-class, and LGBTQIA+ artists maintain a thriving cultural enclave in the heart of Durham. Through innovative programming and strategic partnerships, NorthStar goes beyond traditional artistic support, offering a community hub where working artists can flourish creatively while making an impact on Durham’s social landscape.
Our founder Phil Freelon believed that “art is the most powerful force in the universe,” and our mission is rooted in that mantra. By embracing our unique history and adapting to the evolving needs of Durham, NorthStar is a testament to the potential for inclusivity, equity, and social change through the unifying language of art.
We believe that
artists have the power to engage, uplift and heal communities.
WE believe that
centering the voices of BIPOC & LGBTQIA artists
is a sacred and vital act.
we believe that the
creative process is
a form of
spiritual practice
.
WE BELIEVE IN
CELEBRATING
, THROUGH WORSHIP, THE
LEGACIES OF  PATRON SAINTS OF DURHAM
INCLUDING, BABA CHUCK DAVIS, PAULI MURRAY, MARGARET NYGARD, AND ANN ATWATER.
WE BELIEVE THAT
ELEVATING THE ARTS
IN ALL OF THEIR FORMS
WILL SERVE THE SPIRITUAL NEEDS OF OUR CREATIVE COMMUNITY.
