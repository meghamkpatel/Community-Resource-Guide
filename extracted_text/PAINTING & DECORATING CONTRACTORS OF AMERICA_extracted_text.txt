Practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a surface
This article is about artistic painting. For other uses, see
Painting (disambiguation)
.
"Painter" redirects here. For other uses, see
Painter (disambiguation)
.
Mona Lisa
(1503–1517) by
Leonardo da Vinci
is one of the world's most recognizable paintings.
An artistic depiction of a group of
rhinos
was painted in the
Chauvet Cave
30,000 to 32,000 years ago.
Painting
is a
visual art
, which is characterized by the practice of applying
paint
,
pigment
,
color
or other medium to a solid surface (called the "matrix"
[1]
or "
support
").
[2]
The medium is commonly applied to the base with a
brush
, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and
airbrushes
, may be used.
In
art
, the term "painting" describes both the act and the result of the action (the final work is called "a painting"). The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls, paper, canvas, wood, glass,
lacquer
, pottery,
leaf
, copper and
concrete
, and the painting may incorporate multiple other materials, including sand,
clay
, paper,
plaster
,
gold leaf
, and even whole objects.
Painting is an important form of
visual art
, bringing in elements such as
drawing
,
composition
,
gesture
,
narration
, and
abstraction
.
[3]
Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in
still life
and
landscape painting
),
photographic
, abstract, narrative,
symbolistic
(as in
Symbolist art
),
emotive
(as in
Expressionism
) or
political
in nature (as in
Artivism
).
A portion of the
history of painting
in both Eastern and Western art is dominated by
religious art
. Examples of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting
mythological
figures on
pottery
, to
Biblical
scenes on the
Sistine Chapel ceiling
, to scenes from the life of
Buddha
(or other images of
Eastern religious origin
).
History
[
edit
]
Main article:
History of painting
Prehistoric
cave painting of
aurochs
(
French
:
Bos primigenius primigenius
),
Lascaux
, France
The oldest known figurative painting is a depiction of a bull that was discovered in the
Lubang Jeriji Saléh
cave in
Indonesia
. It was painted 40,000–52,000 years ago or earlier.
The oldest known paintings are approximately 40,000 years old, found in both the
Franco-Cantabrian region
in western Europe, and in the
caves in the district of Maros
(
Sulawesi
,
Indonesia
). In November 2018, however, scientists reported the discovery of the then-oldest known figurative art painting, over 40,000 (perhaps as old as 52,000) years old, of an unknown animal, in the cave of
Lubang Jeriji Saléh
on the
Indonesian island
of
Borneo
(
Kalimantan
).
[4]
[5]
In December 2019, figurative cave paintings depicting pig hunting in the
Maros-Pangkep karst
in
Sulawesi
were estimated to be even older, at at least 43,900 years old. The finding was noted to be "the oldest pictorial record of storytelling and the earliest figurative artwork in the world".
[6]
[7]
More recently, in 2021, cave art of a pig found in an Indonesian island, and dated to over 45,500 years, has been reported.
[8]
[9]
However, the earliest evidence of the act of painting has been discovered in two rock-shelters in
Arnhem Land
, in northern Australia. In the lowest layer of material at these sites, there are used pieces of ochre estimated to be 60,000 years old. Archaeologists have also found a fragment of rock painting preserved in a
limestone rock-shelter
in the
Kimberley
region of North-Western Australia, that is dated to 40,000 years old.
[10]
There are examples of
cave paintings
all over the world—in
Indonesia
,
France
,
Spain
,
Portugal
,
Italy
,
China
,
India
,
Australia
,
Mexico
,
[11]
etc. In Western cultures,
oil painting
and
watercolor
painting have rich and complex traditions in style and subject matter. In the East,
ink
and color ink historically predominated the choice of media, with equally rich and complex traditions.
The invention of photography had a major impact on painting. In the decades after the first
photograph
was produced in 1829,
photographic
processes improved and became more widely practiced, depriving painting of much of its historic purpose to provide an accurate record of the observable world. A series of art movements in the late 19th and early 20th centuries—notably
Impressionism
,
Post-Impressionism
,
Fauvism
,
Expressionism
,
Cubism
, and
Dadaism
—challenged the
Renaissance
view of the world. Eastern and African painting, however, continued a long history of
stylization
and did not undergo an equivalent transformation at the same time.
[

Modern
and
Contemporary art
has moved away from the historic value of craft and documentation in favour of
concept
. This has not deterred the majority of living painters from continuing to practice painting either as a whole or part of their work. The vitality and versatility of painting in the 21st century defy the previous "declarations" of its demise. In an epoch characterized by the idea of
pluralism
, there is no consensus as to a representative style of the age. Artists continue to make important works of art in a wide variety of styles and aesthetic
temperaments
—their merits are left to the public and the marketplace to judge.
The Feminist art movement
[12]
began in the 1960s during the second wave of feminism. The movement sought to gain equal rights and equal opportunities for female artists internationally.

Color and tone
[
edit
]
Color
, made up of
hue
,
saturation
, and
value
, dispersed over a surface is the essence of painting, just as
pitch
and
rhythm
are the essence of
music
. Color is highly subjective, but has observable psychological effects, although these can differ from one culture to the next. Black is associated with mourning in the West, but in the East, white is. Some painters, theoreticians, writers, and scientists, including
Goethe
,
[13]
Kandinsky
,
[14]
and
Newton
,
[15]
have written their own
color theory
.
Moreover, the use of language is only an abstraction for a color equivalent. The word "
red
", for example, can cover a wide range of variations from the pure red of the
visible spectrum
of light. There is not a formalized register of different colors in the way that there is agreement on different notes in music, such as
F
or
C♯
. For a painter, color is not simply divided into basic (primary) and derived (complementary or mixed) colors (like red, blue, green, brown, etc.).
Painters deal practically with
pigments
,
[16]
so "
blue
" for a painter can be any of the blues:
phthalocyanine blue
,
Prussian blue
,
indigo
,
Cobalt blue
,
ultramarine
, and so on. Psychological and symbolical meanings of color are not, strictly speaking, means of painting. Colors only add to the potential, derived context of meanings, and because of this, the perception of a painting is highly subjective. The analogy with music is quite clear—sound in music (like a C note) is analogous to "light" in painting, "shades" to
dynamics
, and "coloration" is to painting as the specific
timbre
of musical instruments is to music. These elements do not necessarily form a melody (in music) of themselves; rather, they can add different contexts to it.
Non-traditional elements
[
edit
]
Modern artists have extended the practice of painting considerably to include, as one example,
collage
, which began with
Cubism
and is not painting in the strict sense. Some modern painters incorporate different materials such as metal, plastic,
sand
,
cement
,
straw
,
leaves
or
wood
for their texture. Examples of this are the works of
Jean Dubuffet
and
Anselm Kiefer
. There is a growing community of artists who use computers to "paint" color onto a digital "canvas" using programs such as
Adobe Photoshop
,
Corel Painter
, and many others. These images can be printed onto traditional canvas if required.
Rhythm
[

]
Jean Metzinger
,
La danse (Bacchante)
(
c.
1906
), oil on canvas, 73 x 54 cm,
Kröller-Müller Museum
Jean Metzinger
's mosaic-like
Divisionist
technique had its parallel in literature; a characteristic of the alliance between
Symbolist
writers and Neo-Impressionist artists:
I ask of divided brushwork not the objective rendering of light, but iridescences and certain aspects of color still foreign to painting. I make a kind of chromatic versification and for syllables, I use strokes which, variable in quantity, cannot differ in dimension without modifying the rhythm of a pictorial phraseology destined to translate the diverse emotions aroused by nature. (Jean Metzinger,
c.
1907
)
[17]
Piet Mondrian

Rhythm
, for artists such as
Piet Mondrian
,
[18]
[19]
is important in painting as it is in music. If one defines rhythm as "a pause incorporated into a sequence", then there can be rhythm in paintings. These pauses allow creative force to intervene and add new creations—form, melody, coloration. The distribution of form or any kind of information is of crucial importance in the given work of art, and it directly affects the aesthetic value of that work. This is because the aesthetic value is functionality dependent, i.e. the freedom (of movement) of perception is perceived as beauty. Free flow of energy, in art as well as in other forms of "
techne
", directly contributes to the aesthetic value.
[18]
Music was important to the birth of
abstract art
since music is abstract by nature—it does not try to represent the exterior world, but expresses in an immediate way the inner feelings of the soul.
Wassily Kandinsky
often used musical terms to identify his works; he called his most spontaneous paintings "improvisations" and described more elaborate works as "compositions". Kandinsky theorized that "music is the ultimate teacher",
[20]
and subsequently embarked upon the first seven of his ten
Compositions
. Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorized that (for example), yellow is the color of middle
C
on a brassy trumpet; black is the color of closure, and the end of things; and that combinations of colors produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano. In 1871 the young Kandinsky learned to play the piano and cello.
[21]
[22]
Kandinsky's stage design for a performance of
Mussorgsky
's
Pictures at an Exhibition
illustrates his "synaesthetic" concept of a universal correspondence of forms, colors and musical sounds.
[23]
Music defines much of modernist abstract painting.
Jackson Pollock
underscores that interest with his 1950 painting
Autumn Rhythm (Number 30)
.
[24]
Aesthetics and theory
[
edit
]
Main article:
Theory of painting
Female painter sitting on a campstool and painting a statue of
Dionysus
or
Priapus
onto a panel which is held by a boy. Fresco from
Pompeii
, 1st century
Aesthetics
is the study of
art
and
beauty
; it was an important issue for 18th- and 19th-century
philosophers
such as
Kant
and
Hegel
. Classical philosophers like
Plato
and
Aristotle
also theorized about art and painting in particular. Plato disregarded painters (as well as sculptors) in his philosophical system; he maintained that painting cannot depict the
truth
—it is a copy of reality (a shadow of the world of ideas) and is nothing but a
craft
, similar to shoemaking or iron casting.
[25]
By the time of Leonardo, painting had become a closer representation of the truth than painting was in
Ancient Greece
.
Leonardo da Vinci
, on the contrary, said that "
Italian
:
La Pittura è cosa mentale
" ("English:
painting is a thing of the mind
").
[26]
Kant distinguished between
Beauty
and the
Sublime
, in terms that clearly gave priority to the former.
[

Although he did not refer to painting in particular, this concept was taken up by painters such as
J.M.W. Turner
and
Caspar David Friedrich
.

Hegel recognized the failure of attaining a universal concept of beauty and, in his aesthetic essay, wrote that painting is one of the three "romantic" arts, along with
Poetry
and
Music
, for its
symbolic
, highly intellectual purpose.
[27]
[28]
Painters who have written theoretical works on painting include
Kandinsky
and
Paul Klee
.
[29]
[30]
In his essay, Kandinsky maintains that painting has a spiritual value, and he attaches
primary colors
to essential feelings or concepts, something that
Goethe
and other writers had already tried to do.
Iconography
is the study of the content of paintings, rather than their style.
Erwin Panofsky
and other
art historians
first seek to understand the things depicted, before looking at their meaning for the viewer at the time, and finally analyzing their wider cultural, religious, and social meaning.
[31]
In 1890, the Parisian painter
Maurice Denis
famously asserted: "Remember that a painting—before being a warhorse, a naked woman or some story or other—is essentially a flat surface covered with colors assembled in a certain order."
[32]
Thus, many 20th-century developments in painting, such as
Cubism
, were reflections on the
means
of painting rather than on the external world—
nature
—which had previously been its core subject. Recent contributions to thinking about painting have been offered by the painter and writer Julian Bell. In his book
What is Painting?
, Bell discusses the development, through history, of the notion that paintings can express feelings and ideas.
[33]
In
Mirror of The World,
Bell writes:
A
work
of art seeks to hold your attention and keep it fixed: a
history
of art urges it onwards, bulldozing a highway through the homes of the imagination.
[34]
Painting media
[
edit
]
Different types of paint are usually identified by the medium that the pigment is suspended or embedded in, which determines the general working characteristics of the paint, such as
viscosity
,
miscibility
,
solubility
, drying time, etc.
Hot wax or encaustic
[
edit
]
Encaustic icon from
Saint Catherine's Monastery
,
Egypt
(6th-century)
Encaustic painting
, also known as hot wax painting, involves using heated
beeswax
to which colored pigments are added. The liquid/paste is then applied to a surface—usually prepared wood, though
canvas
and other materials are often used. The simplest encaustic mixture can be made from adding pigments to beeswax, but there are several other recipes that can be used—some containing other types of
waxes
,
damar resin
,
linseed oil
, or other ingredients. Pure, powdered pigments can be purchased and used, though some mixtures use oil paints or other forms of pigment. Metal tools and special brushes can be used to shape the paint before it cools, or heated metal tools can be used to manipulate the wax once it has cooled onto the surface. Other materials can be encased or
collaged
into the surface, or layered, using the encaustic medium to adhere it to the surface.
The technique was the normal one for ancient Greek and Roman panel paintings, and remained in use in the Eastern Orthodox
icon
tradition.
Watercolor
[
edit
]
John Martin
,
Manfred on the Jungfrau
(1837), watercolor
Watercolor
is a painting method in which the paints are made of pigments suspended in a water-soluble vehicle. The traditional and most common support for watercolor paintings is paper; other supports include
papyrus
, bark papers, plastics,
vellum
or
leather
,
fabric
, wood and
canvas
. In East Asia, watercolor painting with inks is referred to as
brush painting
or scroll painting. In
Chinese
,
Korean
, and
Japanese painting
it has been the dominant medium, often in monochrome black or browns. India,
Ethiopia
and other countries also have long traditions.
Finger-painting
with watercolor paints originated in
China
. There are various types of watercolors used by artists. Some examples are pan watercolors, liquid watercolors, watercolor brush pens, and
watercolor pencils
. Watercolor pencils (water-soluble color pencils) may be used either wet or dry.
Gouache
[
edit
]
Rudolf Reschreiter,
Blick von der Höllentalangerhütte zum Höllentalgletscher und den Riffelwandspitzen
, Gouache (1921)
Gouache
is a water-based paint consisting of pigment and other materials designed to be used in an opaque painting method. Gouache differs from
watercolor
in that the particles are larger, the ratio of pigment to water is much higher, and an additional, inert, white pigment such as
chalk
is also present. This makes gouache heavier and more opaque, with greater reflective qualities. Like all water media, it is diluted with water.
[35]
Gouache was a popular paint utilized by Egyptians,
[36]
Painters such as Francois Boucher used this medium. This paint is best applied with sable brushes.
Ceramic Glaze
Glazing is commonly known as a premelted liquid glass. This glaze can be dipped or brushed on. This glaze appears chalky and there is a vast difference between the beginning and finished result. To be activated glazed pottery must be placed in a kiln to be fired. This melts the Silica glass in the glaze and transforms it into a vibrant glossy version of itself.
[37]
[38]
Ink
[

]
Sesshū Tōyō
,
Landscapes of the Four Seasons
(1486), ink and light color on paper
Ink paintings are done with a liquid that contains pigments or
dyes
and is used to color a surface to produce an image,
text
, or
design
. Ink is used for drawing with a
pen
,
brush
, or
quill
. Ink can be a complex medium, composed of
solvents
, pigments, dyes,
resins
,
lubricants
, solubilizers,
surfactants
,
particulate matter
,
fluorescers
, and other materials. The components of inks serve many purposes; the ink's carrier, colorants, and other additives control flow and thickness of the ink and its appearance when dry.
Enamel

Enamels
are made by painting a substrate, typically metal, with powdered glass; minerals called color oxides provide coloration. After firing at a temperature of 750–850 degrees Celsius (1380–1560 degrees Fahrenheit), the result is a fused lamination of glass and metal.  Unlike most painted techniques, the surface can be handled and wetted Enamels have traditionally been used for decoration of precious objects,
[39]
but have also been used for other purposes.
Limoges enamel
was the leading centre of Renaissance enamel painting, with small religious and mythological scenes in decorated surrounds, on plaques or objects such as
salts
or caskets.  In the 18th century, enamel painting enjoyed a vogue in Europe, especially as a medium for
portrait miniatures
.
[40]
In the late 20th century, the technique of porcelain enamel on metal has been used as a durable medium for outdoor murals.
[41]
Tempera

,
The Birth of Venus
, Tempera (1485–1486)
Tempera
, also known as egg tempera, is a permanent, fast-drying painting medium consisting of colored pigment mixed with a water-soluble
binder
medium (usually a glutinous material such as egg yolk or some other
size
). Tempera also refers to the paintings done in this medium. Tempera paintings are very long-lasting, and examples from the first centuries CE still exist. Egg tempera was a primary method of painting until after 1500 when it was superseded by the invention of
oil painting
. A paint commonly called tempera (though it is not) consisting of pigment and glue size is commonly used and referred to by some manufacturers in America as
poster paint
.
Fresco

Fresco
is any of several related

painting types, done on
plaster

Italian
word
affresco
[afˈfresːko]
, which derives from the Latin word for
fresh
. Frescoes were often made during the Renaissance and other early time periods.
Buon fresco
technique consists of painting in pigment mixed with water on a thin layer of wet, fresh
lime mortar
or
plaster
, for which the Italian word for plaster,
intonaco
, is used.
A secco
painting, in contrast, is done on dry plaster (
secco
is "dry" in Italian). The pigments require a binding medium, such as
egg
(
tempera
), glue or
oil
to attach the pigment to the wall.
Oil
[

Honoré Daumier
,
The Painter
(1808–1879), oil on panel with visible brushstrokes
Oil painting
is the process of painting with
pigments
that are bound with a medium of
drying oil
, such as
linseed oil
, which was widely used in early modern Europe. Often the oil was boiled with a resin such as pine resin or even
frankincense
; these were called 'varnishes' and were prized for their body and gloss. Oil paint eventually became the principal medium used for creating artworks as its advantages became widely known. The transition began with
Early Netherlandish painting
in northern Europe, and by the height of the
Renaissance
oil painting techniques had almost completely replaced
tempera
paints in the majority of Europe.
Pastel
[
edit
]
Maurice Quentin de La Tour
,
Portrait of Louis XV of France
(1748), pastel
Pastel
is a painting medium in the form of a stick, consisting of pure powdered pigment and a binder.
[42]
The pigments used in pastels are the same as those used to produce all colored art media, including
oil paints
; the binder is of a neutral hue and low
saturation
. The color effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than that of any other process.
[43]
Because the surface of a pastel painting is fragile and easily smudged, its preservation requires protective measures such as framing under glass; it may also be sprayed with a
fixative
. Nonetheless, when made with permanent pigments and properly cared for, a pastel painting may endure unchanged for centuries. Pastels are not susceptible, as are paintings made with a fluid medium, to the cracking and discoloration that result from changes in the color, opacity, or dimensions of the medium as it dries.
Acrylic
[
edit
]
Ray Burggraf
,
Jungle Arc
(1998), acrylic paint on wood
Acrylic paint
is fast drying paint containing pigment suspension in
acrylic
polymer
emulsion
. Acrylic paints can be diluted with water but become water-resistant when dry. Depending on how much the paint is diluted (with water) or modified with acrylic gels, media, or pastes, the finished acrylic painting can resemble a
watercolor
or an
oil painting
, or have its own unique characteristics not attainable with other media. The main practical difference between most acrylics and oil paints is the inherent drying time.
[44]
Oils allow for more time to blend colors and apply even glazes over under-paintings. This slow drying aspect of oil can be seen as an advantage for certain techniques but may also impede the artist's ability to work quickly. Another difference is that watercolors must be painted onto a porous surface, primarily watercolor paper. Acrylic paints can be used on many different surfaces.
[44]
[45]
Both acrylic and watercolor are easy to clean up with water. Acrylic paint should be cleaned with soap and water immediately following use. Watercolor paint can be cleaned with just water.
[46]
[47]
[48]
Between 1946 and 1949,
Leonard Bocour
and
Sam Golden
invented a solution acrylic paint under the brand
Magna paint
. These were
mineral spirit
-based paints. Water-based acrylic paints were subsequently sold as
latex
house paints.
[49]
In 1963, George Rowney (part of
Daler-Rowney
since 1983) was the first manufacturer to introduce artists' acrylic paints in Europe, under the brand name "Cryla".
[50]
Acrylics are the most common paints used in
grattage
, a surrealist technique that began to be used with the advent of this type of paint. Acrylics are used for this purpose because they easily scrape or peel from a surface.
[51]
Spray paint
[
edit
]
Aerosol paint
(also called spray paint)
[52]
is a type of paint that comes in a sealed pressurized container and is released in a fine spray mist when depressing a
valve
button. A form of
spray painting
,
aerosol
paint leaves a smooth, evenly coated surface. Standard sized cans are portable, inexpensive and easy to store. Aerosol
primer
can be applied directly to bare metal and many plastics.
Speed, portability and permanence also make aerosol paint a common
graffiti
medium. In the late 1970s, street graffiti writers' signatures and murals became more elaborate, and a unique style developed as a factor of the aerosol medium and the speed required for illicit work. Many now recognize graffiti and street art as a unique art form and specifically manufactured aerosol paints are made for the graffiti artist. A
stencil
protects a surface, except the specific shape to be painted. Stencils can be purchased as movable letters, ordered as professionally cut
logos
or hand-cut by artists.
Water miscible oil paint
[
edit
]
Water miscible oil paints
(also called "water soluble" or "water-mixable") is a modern variety of
oil paint
engineered to be thinned and cleaned up with water,
[53]
[54]
rather than having to use chemicals such as
turpentine
. It can be mixed and applied using the same techniques as traditional oil-based paint, but while still wet it can be effectively removed from brushes, palettes, and rags with ordinary soap and water. Its water solubility comes from the use of an
oil
medium in which one end of the
molecule
has been altered to bind loosely to water molecules, as in a
solution
.

Sandpainting is the art of pouring coloured sands, and powdered pigments from minerals or crystals, or pigments from other natural or synthetic sources onto a surface to make a fixed or unfixed sand painting.
Digital painting
[
edit
]
Main article:
Digital painting
Digital painting is a method of creating an art object (painting) digitally or a technique for making digital art on the computer. As a method of creating an art object, it adapts traditional painting medium such as
acrylic paint
,
oils
,
ink
,
watercolor
, etc. and applies the pigment to traditional carriers, such as woven canvas cloth, paper, polyester, etc. by means of
software
driving
industrial robotic
or office machinery (printers). As a technique, it refers to a
computer graphics
software program that uses a
virtual
canvas and virtual painting box of brushes, colors, and other supplies. The virtual box contains many instruments that do not exist outside the computer, and which give a
digital artwork
a different look and feel from an artwork that is made the traditional way. Furthermore, digital painting is not 'computer-generated' art as the computer does not automatically create images on the screen using some mathematical calculations. On the other hand, the artist uses his own painting technique to create a particular piece of work on the computer.
[55]
Other- Unruly Painting Methods. 
Painting is not confined to one method over another. Artists such as Andy Warhol Explored the limits of painting. Oxidization
[56]
was utilized by Andy Warhol as he painted canvases sprawled on the ground. He then had his assistants and friends urinate on the still-wet
[57]
Paint to witness the visible changes that would occur.
Menstrual Painting
Other interesting painting mediums have helped women and menstruating individuals gain freedom and liberty over their bodies. Blood from menstrual periods has been used to paint images across the world for centuries
[58]
Sarah Maple, a contemporary artist, has used her menstrual blood to create portraits to help erase the taboo covering the topic of periods.
Painting styles
[
edit
]
Main article:
Style (visual arts)
Style
is used in two senses: It can refer to the distinctive visual elements, techniques, and methods that typify an
individual
artist's work. It can also refer to the
movement
or school that an artist is associated with. This can stem from an actual group that the artist was consciously involved with or it can be a category in which art historians have placed the painter. The word 'style' in the latter sense has fallen out of favor in academic discussions about contemporary painting, though it continues to be used in popular contexts. Such movements or classifications include the following:
Western
[
edit
]
Modernism
[
edit
]
Modernism
describes both a set of cultural tendencies and an array of associated
cultural movements
, originally arising from wide-scale and far-reaching changes to
Western society
in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Modernism was a revolt against the conservative values of
realism
.
[59]
[60]
The term encompasses the activities and output of those who felt the "traditional" forms of art, architecture, literature, religious faith, social organization, and daily life were becoming outdated in the new economic, social, and political conditions of an emerging fully industrialized world. A salient characteristic of modernism is self-consciousness. This often led to experiments with form, and work that draws attention to the processes and materials used (and to the further tendency of abstraction).
[61]
Impressionism
[
edit
]
Claude Monet
's 1872
Impression, Sunrise
inspired the name of
the movement
The first example of modernism in painting was
impressionism
, a school of painting that initially focused on work done, not in studios, but outdoors (
en plein air
). Impressionist paintings demonstrated that human beings do not see objects, but instead see light itself. The school gathered adherents despite internal divisions among its leading practitioners and became increasingly influential. Initially rejected from the most important commercial show of the time, the government-sponsored
Paris Salon
, the
Impressionists
organized yearly group exhibitions in commercial venues during the 1870s and 1880s, timing them to coincide with the official Salon. A significant event of 1863 was the
Salon des Refusés
, created by
Emperor Napoleon III
to display all of the paintings rejected by the Paris Salon.
Abstract styles
[
edit
]
Abstract painting
uses a
visual language
of form, colour and line to create a composition that may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world.
[62]
[63]
Abstract expressionism
was an American post-
World War II
art movement
that combined the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German
Expressionists
with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools—such as
Futurism
,
Bauhaus
and
Cubism
, and the image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, nihilistic.
[64]
Action painting
, sometimes called
gestural abstraction
, is a style of painting in which paint is spontaneously dribbled, splashed or smeared onto the canvas, rather than being carefully applied.
[65]
The resulting work often emphasizes the physical act of painting itself as an essential aspect of the finished work or concern of its artist. The style was widespread from the 1940s until the early 1960s and is closely associated with
abstract expressionism
(some critics have used the terms "action painting" and "abstract expressionism" interchangeably).
Other modernist styles include:
Color Field
Lyrical Abstraction
Hard-edge painting
Pop art
Outsider art
[
edit
]
The term
outsider art
was coined by
art critic
Roger Cardinal in 1972 as an English synonym for art brut (
French:
[aʁ
bʁyt]
, "raw art" or "rough art"), a label created by
French
artist
Jean Dubuffet
to describe
art
created outside the boundaries of official culture; Dubuffet focused particularly on art by
insane-asylum
inmates.
[66]
Outsider art has emerged as a successful art marketing category (an annual Outsider Art Fair has taken place in New York since 1992). The term is sometimes misapplied as a catch-all marketing label for art created by people outside the mainstream "art world," regardless of their circumstances or the content of their work.
Photorealism
[
edit
]
Photorealism
is the genre of painting based on using the camera and photographs to gather information and then from this information, creating a painting that appears to be very realistic like a
photograph
. The term is primarily applied to paintings from the United States
art movement
that began in the late 1960s and early 1970s. As a full-fledged art movement, Photorealism evolved from
Pop Art
[67]
[68]
[69]
and as a counter to
Abstract Expressionism
.
Hyperrealism
is a genre of painting and sculpture resembling a high-resolution
photograph
.
Hyperrealism
is a fully-fledged school of
art
and can be considered an advancement of Photorealism by the methods used to create the resulting paintings or sculptures. The term is primarily applied to an independent art movement and art style in the United States and Europe that has developed since the early 2000s.
[70]
Surrealism
[
edit
]
Surrealism
is a cultural movement that began in the early 1920s and is best known for the artistic and literary production of those affiliated with the
Surrealist Movement
. Surrealist artworks feature the element of surprise, the uncanny, the unconscious, unexpected juxtapositions and
non-sequitur
; however, many Surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost, with the works being an artifact. Leader
André Breton
was explicit in his assertion that Surrealism was above all a revolutionary movement.
Surrealism developed out of the
Dada
activities of
World War I
and the most important center of the movement was
Paris
. From the 1920s onward, the movement spread around the globe, eventually affecting the
visual arts
,
literature
,
film
and
music
of many countries, as well as
political
thought and practice,
philosophy
and
social theory
.

Miniature painting
[
edit
]
Miniature paintings were the primary form of painting in pre-colonial India. These were done on a special paper (known as wasli) using mineral and natural colours. Miniature painting is not one style but a group of several styles of schools of painting such as Mughal, Pahari, Rajasthani, Company style etc.
Mughal miniature
painting
is a particular style of
South Asian
, particularly North Indian (more specifically, modern day India and Pakistan), painting confined to
miniatures
either as book illustrations or as single works to be kept in albums (
muraqqa
). It emerged
[71]
from
Persian miniature
painting (itself partly of
Chinese origin
) and developed in the court of the
Mughal Empire
of the 16th to 18th centuries. Mughal painting immediately took a much greater interest in realistic portraiture than was typical of Persian miniatures. Animals and plants were the main subject of many miniatures for albums, and were more realistically depicted.
[72]
[73]
[74]
Rajasthani painting
evolved and flourished in the royal courts of
Rajputana
[75]
in northern India, mainly during the 17th century. Artists trained in the tradition of the
Mughal miniature
were dispersed from the
Krishna and Radha
, might be the work of
Nihâl Chand
, master of Kishangarh school of Rajput Painting
imperial Mughal court, and developed styles also drawing from local traditions of painting, especially those illustrating the Sanskrit Epics, the
Mahabharata
and
Ramayana
. Subjects varied, but portraits of the ruling family, often engaged in hunting or their daily activities, were generally popular, as were narrative scenes from the epics or
Hindu mythology
, as well as some
genre scenes
of landscapes, and humans.
[76]
[77]
Punjab Hills or
Pahari painting
of which Kangra, Guller, Basholi were major sub-styles. Kangra painting is the pictorial art of
Kangra
, named after
Kangra
,
Himachal Pradesh
, a former
princely state
, which patronized the art. It became prevalent with the fading of
Basohli school of painting
in mid-18th century.
[78]
[79]
The focal theme of Kangra painting is Shringar (the erotic sentiment). The subjects are seen in Kangra painting exhibit the taste and the traits of the lifestyle of the society of that period.
[80]
The artists adopted themes from the love poetry of
Jayadeva
and
Keshav Das
who wrote ecstatically of the love of
Radha
and
Krishna
with
Bhakti
being the driving force.
[81]
[82]
Khan Bahadur Khan with Men of his Clan, c. 1815, from the Fraser Album, Company Style
Company style
is a term for a hybrid Indo-European style of paintings made in India by Indian artists, many of whom worked for European patrons in the
British East India Company
or other foreign Companies in the 18th and 19th centuries.
[83]
Three distinct styles of Company Painting emerged in three British Power Centres –
Delhi
,
Calcutta
and
Madras
. The subject matter of company paintings made for western patrons was often documentary rather than imaginative, and as a consequence, the Indian artists were required to adopt a more naturalistic approach to painting than had traditionally been usual.
[84]
[85]
The
Sikh style
and
Deccan style
are other prominent Miniature painting styles of India.
Pichwai painting
[
edit
]
Pichwai paintings
are paintings on textile and usually depicting stories from the life of Lord Krishna.
[86]
These were made in large format and often used as a backdrop to the main idol in temples or homes. Pichwai paintings were made and are still made mainly in Rajasthan, India. However very few were made in the Deccan region, but these are extremely rare. The purpose of pichhwais, other than artistic appeal, is to narrate tales of Krishna to the illiterate. Temples have sets with different images, which are changed according to the
calendar of festivals celebrating the deity
.
[87]
Folk and tribal art
[
edit
]
Pattachitra is a general term for traditional, cloth-based
scroll
painting, based in the eastern Indian
states
of
Odisha
and
West Bengal
.
[88]
The Pattachitra painting tradition is closely linked with the worship of Lord
Jagannath
in Odisha.
[89]
The subject matter of Pattachitra is limited to religious themes. Patachitra artform is known for its intricate details as well as mythological narratives and folktales inscribed in it. All colours used in the Paintings are natural and paintings are made fully old traditional way by Chitrakaras that is Odiya Painter. Pattachitra style of painting is one of the oldest and most popular art forms of
Odisha
. Patachitras are a component of an ancient
Bengali
narrative art, originally serving as a visual device during the performance of a song.
[90]
[91]
[92]
Madhubani Art is a style of
Indian painting
, practiced in the
Mithila region
of India and Nepal. The style is characterized by complex geometrical patterns, these paintings are famous for representing ritual content used for particular occasions like festivals, religious rituals etc.
[93]
Warli
is another folk tribal art form from India.
Bengal School
[
edit
]
The Bengal School
[94]
was an
art movement
and a style of
Indian painting
that originated in
Bengal
, primarily
Kolkata
and
Shantiniketan
, and flourished throughout the
Indian subcontinent
, during the
British Raj
in the early 20th century.
[95]
The Bengal school arose as an
avant garde
and nationalist movement reacting against the
academic art
styles previously promoted in India, both by Indian artists such as
Raja Ravi Varma
and in British art schools. The school wanted to establish a distinct Indian style which celebrated the indigenous cultural heritage. In an attempt to reject colonial aesthetics,
Abanindranath Tagore
also turned to China and Japan with the intent of promoting a pan-Asian aesthetic and incorporated elements from Far Eastern art, such as the
Japanese wash technique
.

Allegory
is a
figurative
mode
of representation conveying meaning other than the literal. Allegory communicates its message by means of
symbolic
figures, actions, or symbolic representation. Allegory is generally treated as a figure of
rhetoric
, but an allegory does not have to be expressed in
language
: it may be addressed to the eye and is often found in realistic painting. An example of a simple visual allegory is the image of the
grim reaper
. Viewers understand that the image of the grim reaper is a symbolic representation of death.

Reza Abbasi

Two Lovers
(1630)
In
Spanish art
, a
bodegón
is a
still life
painting depicting pantry items, such as victuals, game, and drink, often arranged on a simple stone slab, and also a painting with one or more figures, but significant still life elements, typically set in a kitchen or tavern. Starting in the
Baroque
period, such paintings became popular in Spain in the second quarter of the 17th century. The tradition of still life painting appears to have started and was far more popular in the contemporary
Low Countries
, today Belgium and
Netherlands
(then Flemish and Dutch artists), than it ever was in
southern Europe
.
Northern still lifes
had many subgenres: the
breakfast piece
was augmented by the
trompe-l'œil
, the
flower bouquet
, and the
vanitas
. In Spain, there were much fewer patrons for this sort of thing, but a type of
breakfast piece
did become popular, featuring a few objects of food and tableware laid on a table.
Figure painting
[
edit
]
A
figure painting
is a
work of art
in any of the painting media with the primary subject being the human figure, whether clothed or
nude
.
Figure painting may also refer to the activity of creating such a work. The human figure has been one of the contrast subjects of art since the first Stone Age cave paintings and has been reinterpreted in various styles throughout history.
[100]
Some artists well known for figure painting are
Peter Paul Rubens
,
Edgar Degas
, and
Édouard Manet
.
Illustration painting
[
edit
]
Illustration
paintings are those used as illustrations in books, magazines, and theater or movie
posters
and comic books. Today, there is a growing interest in collecting and admiring the original artwork. Various museum exhibitions, magazines, and art galleries have devoted space to the illustrators of the past. In the visual art world, illustrators have sometimes been considered less important in comparison with fine artists and
graphic designers
. But as the result of
computer game
and comic industry growth, illustrations are becoming valued as popular and profitable artworks that can acquire a wider market than the other two, especially in
Korea
, Japan,
Hong Kong
and the United States.
The illustrations of medieval
codices
were known as
illuminations
, and were individually hand-drawn and painted. With the invention of the
printing press
during the 15th century,
books
became more widely distributed, and often illustrated with
woodcuts
.
[101]
[102]
In
America
, this led to a "golden age of illustration" from before the 1880s until the early 20th century. A small group of illustrators became highly successful, with the imagery they created considered a portrait of American aspirations of the time.
[103]
Among the best-known illustrators of that period were
N.C. Wyeth
and
Howard Pyle
of the
Brandywine School
,
James Montgomery Flagg
,
Elizabeth Shippen Green
,
J. C. Leyendecker
,
Violet Oakley
,
Maxfield Parrish
,
Jessie Willcox Smith
, and
John Rea Neill
. In
France
, on 1905, the Contemporary Book Society commissioned
Paul Jouve
to illustrate
Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book
. Paul Jouve will devote ten years to the 130 illustrations of this book which will remain as one of the masterpieces of bibliophilia.

Landscape painting
[

]
Main article:
Landscape art
Andreas Achenbach
,
Clearing Up, Coast of Sicily
(1847),
The Walters Art Museum
[105]
[106]
Landscape painting
is a term that covers the depiction of natural scenery such as mountains, valleys, trees, rivers, lakes, and forests, and especially art where the main subject is a wide view, with its elements arranged into a coherent composition. In other works, landscape backgrounds for figures can still form an important part of the work. The sky is almost always included in the view, and
weather
is often an element of the composition. Detailed landscapes as a distinct subject are not found in all artistic traditions and develop when there is already a sophisticated tradition of representing other subjects. The two main traditions spring from
Western painting
and
Chinese art
, going back well over a thousand years in both cases.
Portrait painting
[
edit
]
Ned Bittinger
,
Portrait of Abraham Lincoln
in Congress
(2004),
US Capitol
Portrait paintings
are representations of a person, in which the face and its expression is predominant. The intent is to display the likeness,
personality
, and even the mood of the person. The art of the portrait flourished in Ancient Greek and especially
Roman sculpture
, where sitters demanded individualized and realistic portraits, even unflattering ones. One of the best-known portraits in the Western world is
Leonardo da Vinci
's painting titled
Mona Lisa
, which is thought to be a portrait of
Lisa Gherardini
, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo.
[107]
Warhol was one of the most prolific portrait painters of the 20th century. Warhol's painting
Orange Shot Marilyn
of
Marilyn Monroe
is an iconic early example of his work from the 1960s, and
Orange Prince (1984)
of the pop singer
Prince
is later example, both exhibiting Warhol's unique graphic style of portraiture.

Still life
[
edit
]
Otto Marseus van Schrieck
,
A Forest Floor Still-Life
(1666)
A
still life
is a work of
art
depicting mostly
inanimate
subject matter, typically commonplace objects—which may be either natural (food, flowers, plants, rocks, or shells) or human-made (drinking glasses, books, vases, jewelry, coins, pipes, and so on). With origins in the Middle Ages and Ancient Greek/Roman art, still life paintings give the artist more leeway in the arrangement of design elements within a composition than do paintings of other types of subjects such as
landscape
or
portraiture
. Still life paintings, particularly before 1700, often contained religious and allegorical symbolism relating to the objects depicted. Some modern still life breaks the two-dimensional barrier and employs three-dimensional mixed media, and uses found objects, photography, computer graphics, as well as video and sound.
Veduta
[
edit
]
A
veduta
is a highly detailed, usually large-scale painting of a
cityscape
or some other vista. This
genre
of
landscape
originated in
Flanders
, where artists such as
Paul Bril
painted
vedute
as early as the 16th century. As the itinerary of the
Grand Tour
became somewhat standardized,
vedute
of familiar scenes like the Roman Forum or the Grand Canal recalled early ventures to the Continent for aristocratic Englishmen. In the later 19th century, more personal impressions of cityscapes replaced the desire for topographical accuracy, which was satisfied instead by painted
panoramas
.
