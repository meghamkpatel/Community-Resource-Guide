About the TreeCircus Partnership
The Britton Fund is proud to support the work of the TreeCircus by supplying copies of “Treetures Join the TreeCircus”, a coloring, comic book given to children of all ages! This publication promotes a playful but serious message about how important trees are to our lives, our health, and the health of our planet.
The TreeCircus is an energetic stage show that is interactive, educational and captivating for all ages.  Edutainer Timmy Womick covers it all, from urban particulate pollution to basic tree biology, while keeping the audience in stitches.

During their performances, TreeCircus discusses numerous tidbits about biology, showing how trees filter urban particulate pollution.  They help students understand how their local trees can lower the temperature and raise their spirits. Throughout the hour-long program, participants learn many things about trees, including: their value, why we should plant more of them, and even how to climb them like the pros. Those who suddenly find themselves a part of the TreeCircus act, out in front of the audience, generally blossom in their own right. Student participation is what these programs are all about.
The show is often capped off with a climbing demonstration by world-class tree climbing competitor, Chad Brey and tree climbing instructor,  Grayson Keating  demonstrating an often overlooked gift of trees – jobs!
