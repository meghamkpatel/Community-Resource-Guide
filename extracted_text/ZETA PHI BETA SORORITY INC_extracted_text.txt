People Impacted
Finer Womanhood
Often imitated but never duplicated, Zetas have been Finer since 1920, when Finer Womanhood became a sorority hallmark. Unique to our sisterhood, Finer Womanhood celebrates the standards, morals, customs, and attributes all women strive to possess.
Sisterhood
With over 125,000 initiated college-educated women, Zeta represents diverse careers ranging from businesswomen, elected officials, educators, doctors, nurses, military, and attorneys. We are mothers, grandmothers, sisters, aunts, and friends. Our bond is strong and cannot be broken.
