Give It Thought Blog
Engage with what we believe about the heart and strategy of giving and how it informs our philanthropic advice.
Just when I had been losing faith in poverty alleviation, in the Church, and in myself, Simple Charity reminded me that there is real power in all three.
Indigo Funk,
2021 Summer Intern
I wanted to start a chapter ultimately because of the Great Commission, and I want people in our club to disciple and raise up leaders that care deeply about global poverty...I hope that we are able to be a community that walks together in Truth and truly practices solidarity, whether it is through prayer, fasting, or giving.
Kaylin Yang,
Chapter Founder at the University of Virginia
Simple Charity has challenged me in my faith more than any other club on campus. Not only has it gently pushed me to confront my apathy towards the global poor, but it has also urged me to live out God's word in all aspects of life.
John Kang,
Chapter Member at Duke University
TAKE ACTION
"Only they asked us to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do."
