Our History
Our Community
Our History
With the Muslim community branching into such areas of the RTP, a masjid (mosque) in the North Durham area became a necessity rather than a luxury. Several years ago, group of brothers recognized that need and began planning the establishment of the North
Durham Masjid to accommodate the Muslims of North Durham.
Our Mission
Our Community
Our History
We envision our North Durham Masjid  as a comprehensive community center fully serving both spiritual and practical needs of the Muslim community, while creating outreach to embrace the larger community of Muslims and non-Muslims.

Our Community
Due to the increasing needs of our growing community it has become a necessity to expand our masjid.  The land will be developed to have a prayer hall, multipurpose event hall, classrooms,
recreation area and plenty of parking to
overcome the existing parking problem.
This project is a multi-stage project.
The end goal is to satisfy the current
and future needs of our community
