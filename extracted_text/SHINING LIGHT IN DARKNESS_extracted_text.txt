WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING
Survivor
Shining Light is exactly what’s I experienced with this service that was provided to my daughter and I while in dark place that’s exactly what I’ve experienced. I was totally skeptical at first but they immediately made my daughter and I feel comfortable by making sure our needs were met.
Briana Dearing
Department of Social Services
Durham, NC
Shining Light In Darkness is a literal lifesaver.  This organization has always been eager to work with families with multiple, complex issues and are incredibly tenacious.  Even if a client is initially resistant (which so many families that experience DV are) they meet the client where they are.  They are incredibly patient and NEVER give up!   I know when I refer a family to Shining Light In Darkness they will be getting all of the support they need.
Local Victim Advocate
Shining Light in Darkness is a gem. This organization assisted with relocating a victim back to Durham who was sheltered elsewhere in NC. They provided a two week stay at a local hotel in addition to clothing, food, ride share services, and therapy for the victim during her stay. Their capacity to help victims in precarious situations is outstanding and second to none. I am very impressed by the services that Shining Light in Darkness provided and will reach out to them again when similar situations arise.
