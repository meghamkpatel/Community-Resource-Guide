Inscription in honor of
Straton, King of Sidon
, giving him the title of
proxenos
: "Also Straton the king of Sidon shall be proxenos of the People of Athens, both himself and his descendants".
[1]
Acropolis of Athens
. This indicates that relations of proxeny existed not only among Greek cities but also with non-Greeks (Phoenicians in this case).
Proxeny
or
proxenia
(
Greek
:
προξενία
) in
ancient Greece
was an arrangement whereby a citizen (chosen by the city) hosted foreign ambassadors at his own expense, in return for honorary titles from the state. The citizen was called
proxenos
(
πρόξενος
; plural:
proxenoi
or
proxeni
, "instead of a foreigner") or
proxeinos
(
πρόξεινος
). The proxeny
decrees
, which amount to
letters patent
and
resolutions of appreciation
were issued by one state to a citizen of another for service as
proxenos
, a kind of
honorary consul
looking after the interests of the other state's citizens. A common phrase is
euergetes
(benefactor) and
proxenos
(
πρόξεινος τε ειη και ευεργέτης
).
A proxenos would use whatever influence he had in his own city to promote policies of friendship or alliance with the city he voluntarily represented. For example,
Cimon
was
Sparta
's proxenos at
Athens
and during his period of prominence in Athenian politics, previous to the outbreak of the
First Peloponnesian War
, he strongly advocated a policy of cooperation between the two states. Cimon was known to be so fond of Sparta that he named one of his sons
Lacedaemonius
(as Sparta was known as
Lacedaemon
in antiquity).
[2]
[3]
Being another city's proxenos did not preclude taking part in war against that city, should it break out – since the proxenos' ultimate loyalty was to his own city. However, a proxenos would naturally try his best to prevent such a war and to resolve the differences that were threatening to cause it. And once peace negotiations were on the way, a proxenos' contacts and goodwill in the enemy city could be profitably used by his city.
The position of proxenos for a particular city was often hereditary in a particular family.
A 2024 study in the
Journal of Economic History
linked the presence of proxeny arrangements to increases in trade flows.
