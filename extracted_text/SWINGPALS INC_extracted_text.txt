lives

By experiencing first-class golf and mindfulness coaching, as well as community-focused service projects, students develop mentoring and leadership skills and connection to others, giving them the confidence to step outside their comfort zone and challenge their status quo.

TESTIMONIALS
I love how
SwingPals
can cheer me up whenever I'm having a bad day, or just make my day in general.
No matter what had happened in school or my personal life, I could always come to
SwingPals
and have people to talk to and have a great time doing s
omething I've learned to love.
SwingPals
has definitely improved my personal and social relationships with people. I've been able to be a lot calmer and even more confident with the skills
SwingPals
has taug
ht me. It helps me focus and calm down, no matter what's going on, whether it be nerves or stress.
SwingPals
has had a trem
endous impact on how I interact with people and my relationships, and
without it, I would have never found my true passion and love for golfing, which is something I never thought I would enjoy until I picked up that plastic club
for the very first time in that little gym at my school.”
Kayleigh,
Lowe’s Grove Middle School
“Every day we tell our students there are many people in the community who care about them - you are one. Thank you for being on the
SwingPals
team.” Coach Hodges
