Pastoral Greetings:
Welcome and thank you for visiting Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church website. Shiloh is a church with a rich history and heritage that has allowed us to see over one hundred and forty years of continuous fellowship.
We are a Bible teaching church which encourages its members to study the word of God in private, at bible study and in Sunday school. We believe that God has messages for us in His word and that we must diligently be seekers of his truth.
It is our desire at Shiloh to reach out and to let others know the goodness of the Lord.
​If you are seeking a church home we ask that you pray and seek direction from the Holy Spirit. If at anytime you need prayer and/or counseling, please contact me , any of our officers or a member of our church.
We pray that God continues to bless and keep you.
Rev. David L. Jones Jr.

"A C
hurch Where Everybody is Somebody and God is all"
I've grown to love each and every one of you
Although there is a beacon among us -so valiant and true
He's our leader, our confidant, our Pastor and friend
And we know he's with us from beginning to end
He preaches, he teachers and he even sings
Boy can he do a lot of things!!
He's a child of God, a husband and Paw Paw too!!
There's no end to the things that he can do!!
Did I tell you that he's a student and scholar too?
There's no limit to the things he's going to do
So, let's stand by him, praise him and keep him lifted up,
That way, the blessings will also be in our cup!!
Shiloh, Stand up and give our Pastor a big hand
​And know -- Pastor Jones -- You're the man !!

God Made Pastors
God laid His hand upon them.
and breathed hope into their spirits,
He filled them with His strength,
and placed a message of urgency around their lives.
God challenged them to greater works
than he had ever done.
Then, with His own hand of blessing.
He wrapped them up in His mantle of love
and called them Pastors.
​
Lord, Help My Pastor
Lord, Help my Pastor, I pray
There are many obstacles in the way
Every burden help him to bear
Dear Lord, keep him in your tender care
Give him strength and the ability
To care for the church and his family
Lord, there is so much he has to do
So shelter him in your loving arms
Safe from all danger and unsee harm
Guard his mouth, his heart and mind
Remove every tittle of sin and pride
Keep him in the hour of temptation
May he not be moved by satan's persuasion
Remove all fears, Lord, remove all doubt
By your spirit, Lord, be in his mouth
So that he will speak a word that is due
And bring your dear people closer to you.
​In Jesus Name, Amen

Feed My Sheep
A small voice in the dark
Whispering to an open heart
My child , My child, listen to me
and the words to you I speak
My child, My child , feed my sheep
What do I have to give, I asked
Those who sorrow and despair
Those who know no hope or love
What can I feed your sheep
Master, Master, I ask You
Hear My voice upon your heart
Listen closely to what I say
As I feed you my words
and also with my love and grace, so shall you
​My child, My child, feed my sheep
