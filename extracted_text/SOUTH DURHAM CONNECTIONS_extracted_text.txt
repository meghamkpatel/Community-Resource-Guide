About Us
What We Do
The Parktown Food Hub is working to help people in the Southern part of Durham, North Carolina build relationships across the lines that divide us by creating opportunities to live, learn, and love our neighbors - especially around sharing food. Find our calendar of events, volunteer hours and food distribtutions

Nourishing Community
The Parktown Food Hub is a place where hungry people can go to be fed. Food is not the only thing that the Hub provides, though. Opportunities to meet others, work together, and contribute to the community are also part of our mission. Check out the "Events" page to learn more about what's happening.
