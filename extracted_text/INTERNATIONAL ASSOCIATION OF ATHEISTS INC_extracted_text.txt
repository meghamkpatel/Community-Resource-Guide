Who we are
AAI is a global federation of atheist groups and individuals. We are the only atheist group accredited with UN Special Consultative status.
What we do
AAI speaks up for atheists everywhere. We support atheists in danger and we educate people about atheism. Our goal is a secular world.
Homage to Daniel Dennett: Champion of Reason and Enlightenment
Daniel Dennett has dedicated his life to the pursuit of truth and understanding, inspiring generations to come to follow in his footsteps and continue the quest for knowledge and enlightenment. As we honor his memory, let us recommit ourselves to the principles he held dear, knowing that with courage and conviction, we can build a world guided by reason and compassion, where ignorance fades and enlightenment flourishes.

I really want to thank AAI for their continuous help after my husband’s (Mubarak Bala) disappearance since 28th April, 2020. AAI has been helping me both financially and emotionally because Mubarak was taken away when our son was 6 weeks old.

Wife of Mubarak Bala
AAI came to my aid from the very moment I have contacted them, emotionally, financially, and finally to safety. They did help me survive and supported me emotionally when I had no one to lean on! I will forever be thankful for them and will never forget what they did for me.

Atheist Support Network
Do you have the freedom to believe or not believe in a religion? In many countries, nonbelievers do not have this freedom, and in thirteen countries, nonbelievers face arrest or a death sentence!
Atheist Alliance International has been working to help atheists and ex-Muslims for years but we significantly ramped up our efforts in 2019 by developing the Atheist Support Network (ASN).

Professor George Paxinos is the scientist who mapped the brain of humans and the principal experimental animals:
"We just published The Rhesus Monkey Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. The monkey and the chimpanzee have homologous (corresponding) brain structures to humans, though the chimpanzee brain is half the size. In whatever else humans may resemble the divine, in the brain they are made in the image of the chimpanzee."

Atheism is a Ground for Asylum
In a very important decision by a Greek Court, atheism has been recognized as a legitimate ground for claiming asylum!  This is the first time a Greek court has made this determination, and we believe, a first anywhere in the world. Atheism is now recognised as a ground for the vulnerability of a person in a fundamentalist religious state.
It can now be argued, in Europe at least, that atheists are at special risk in some Islamic countries and, consequently, need to be protected.

Umar Farouk is FREE!
Today, prison guards escorted Umar Farouk to a Kano court where he was handed over to our lawyers. Sixteen-year-old Umar had been found guilty of blasphemy in a Kano magistrates court on August 10 and was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment with menial labor.
AAI engaged a legal team in Nigeria to appeal his sentence.

Know someone who loves books?
Books are a wonderful present that can last a lifetime. We have curated a treasure trove of books on all aspects of atheism, and other topics too—including a selection of books suitable for kids.
Many of these books will be especially valuable for people who are doubting their religion and for people who have recently discarded their religion and want to learn more.
