“Common Ground” for people of all ages, cultures, and backgrounds to participate, interact, and connect."
Stew
by Zora
Howard

TRE
April 5–21, 2024
Preview performance: April 5th @ 7:30 pm
Opening Night:
April 6th @ 7:30 pm
Mama is up early to prepare an important meal and, even with her family on hand to help, time is running short. Tensions simmer with three generations of Tucker women under one roof, but things come to a boil as the violence hovering around the periphery of their lives begins to intrude. The kitchen becomes a microcosm of the family, a protection from outside traumas with the making of the stew a challenging task (it gets ruined twice) and a group activity needed to keep the family together. (STRONG LANGUAGE)
