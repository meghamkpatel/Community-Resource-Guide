Our teaching and learning strategy had to convert to fully online very quickly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and Mediasite certainly helped with that transition. Being able to deploy Mediasite cost effectively through MCNC gave our College and faculty a simple way to record lectures from home.Â

Distance learning Technical Administrator
Edgecombe Community College
â
On behalf of my entire campus, I want to thank the whole MCNC team for all of the work done in the past few months during the COVID-19 crisis, as well as projects going forward. Providing Zoom Pro licenses has helped our campus greatly during this pandemic. MCNC continues to be one of the best and most reliable partners the State has ever had.
Jonathan Vester
VP of Technology and Chief Information Officer
Nash Community College
â
Weâre driven today by partnering with economic development leaders like MCNC to provide real-time education capabilities and job training to build and create jobs in North Carolina. New technology helps these students experience synchronous and asynchronous learning using leading-edge video tools and self-driven/user-driven applications such as Movi at a much lower cost."
Jonathan Vester

â
The service, support and guidance we receive from MCNC continue to be a vital part of our technology efforts. Our MCNC Internet service, firewall, and cloud-based content filter are all integral to our school's success - and these ultimately allow us to have the tools that fulfill our chartered mission, providing a college prep education for our students. When we have technology issues, our staff can rely on the sound advice and problem-solving ability we always receive whenever we have to seek MCNC Client Network Engineering (CNE) support. We cannot thank MCNC and their staff enough for all that they do to support us.

The power of NCREN gives us the ability to share the real science happening at PARI with thousands of students, teachers, researchers, and science enthusiasts throughout North Carolina and all over the world. This level of connectivity is a key component to extending our programs and services to a broader segment of the population."
Don Cline

PARI
â
As more data comes in and out every day, we need high-speed connections to realize all these data sets. We have better download rates now and as others get more speeds soon, we will be ready as we continue to future-proof our infrastructure."
Preston Carter
IT Specialist for Network Operations & Storage
NCDC
â
MCNC is our key partner that helps us achieve our mission of using cyber infrastructure to enable research discoveries and practical problem solving. We have a truly collaborative and mutually beneficial relationship. Whether researchers need high-performance computing, cyber tools for analysis and collaboration or data management solutions, none of it would be possible if we didnât have robust, reliable, high-performance networking ... without NCREN we would literally be in the dark.â
Stan Ahalt

One of the great things about working with MCNC is that they understand that access to medical applications [through broadband service] is a life and death issue.â
Jean Payne

â
The service paid for itself in one phishing attack! When folks clicked the email document, it looked like nothing happened, however, when I investigated, I found out that the document was redirecting them to a site that was being blocked by the DNS filtering service. If it hadnât been for the DNS Filtering Service, we would have been hit hard.â
Jeffery C Benfield
Chief Information Officer
Mitchell Community College
â
We were very satisfied with our recent Cyber Hygiene Assessment performed by MCNC. It provided an independent look at our operations and made us notice deficiencies that we had not yet discovered or considered. Thank you for making this service available to school systems."

Nancy Zeiss
Watauga County Schools, K-12 Client
â
As a small college, itâs been tremendously valuable to have a team of security professionals we can reach out to when we need guidance. MCNCâs Advisory Services helped us maintain operations during a staff vacancy, and even now that weâre fully staffed, we continue to rely on them for advice, consulting and perspective when our team has questions of concerns. MCNC has been a great partner for years in bandwidth and hosting, and itâs great to get their help in security, too.â
Kevin Davis
Chief Information Officer
Davidson College Technology & Innovation

Our engagement with MCNC Advisory Consulting Services has been tremendously helpful. Their skilled and knowledgeable staff has helped us build a plan of action to address our issues and we appreciate the expertise they bring to the table.â

Weâve found the MCNC Ethernet service to be very fast and quite reliable. We are fortunate to have their service available near a rural library location where broadband was not available to us by a commercial vendor. Their pricing is more than competitive, and they communicated well with us during the installation process."
Jonathan P. Wark
Director
East Albemarle Regional Library System & Dare County Librarian
â
I can't say enough good things about MCNC. Their service and support has been exemplary in every particular. For quality and reliability, they simply can't be beaten."
