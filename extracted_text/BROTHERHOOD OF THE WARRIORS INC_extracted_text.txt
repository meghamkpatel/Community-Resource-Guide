Welcome to The Brotherhood
The Brotherhood of Warriors is a nonprofit 501c3 (EIN 47-3128732) that helps an ever growing group of “combat” veterans find peace, motivation, direction, and brotherhood.  Some have visible wounds, some have invisible wounds, some have both, and some claim none at all, but they are all combat Vets and they all have a story.  The Brotherhood of Warriors is a group that will be supporting vets through outings and activities, those truly in need financially, therapeutically, and any other way our board deems appropriate.
Location
PuzzleDuck Golf  is the home base of The Brotherhood.

Testimonials
June 26, 2015
"With little debate, Brad Clayton is a great golf instructor, but that is the least of his skills - he is an even better man. Brad is kind and compassionate, and devotes much of his time to help wounded veterans like myself."
June 25, 2015
"Not only has Brad helped us with the physical aspects of golf he has also helped us to realize with help and modification we can still do the things we use to do."
June 25, 2015
"Brad continually amazes me with his “love Life” spirit and his ability to connect with rough, battle-hardened grown men that have suffered in service to our Nation."
