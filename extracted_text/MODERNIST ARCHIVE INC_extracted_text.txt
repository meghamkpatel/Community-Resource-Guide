Documenting, Preserving, and Promoting Modernist 
					Residential Architecture
You cannot save something valuable without knowing where it is or why it is important. Americaâs brilliant mid-century Modernist houses are frequently endangered and torn down, largely because buyers, sellers, and realtors do not realize the importance of what they have or how to preserve, repair, and protect these livable works of art. With documentation on over 20,100 iconic houses and 130 important architects, and over 4.3 million pages of architecture and design magazines, USModernist is Americaâs largest open digital archive of Modernist houses, an
award-winning
nonprofit 501(c)(3) educational archive for the documentation, preservation, and promotion of residential Modernist architecture.
Whatâs a Modernist House?
What is a Modernist house? Modernist design is characterized by features such as combining traditionally separate common areas (like the living room and the dining room, for example), open interior floor plans with vaulted ceilings, large and numerous windows, flat or low pitch roofs, long exposed beams, extensive use of glass to bring in natural light, and unusual geometric forms. Early Modernist architects wanted to change the way people lived by making houses and objects more affordable through better materials, streamlined building, and family connectivity. Gone were formal living and dining roomsâinstead, there was a large family space where kitchen, dining, and living rooms flow into each otherâand smaller private bedrooms.
More than anything, Modernism creates feelings of optimismâa better, brighter future than the past.
