We Inspire Girls in STEM
We Inspire Girls in STEM - STEMblazers inspires girls to visualize themselves in science, technology, engineering, and math professions. Our long-term goal is to reach
1 million girls by 2050
and influence them to pursue a career in STEM. We envision a world where women are equally represented in the STEM workforce.

Gender
Gap
in STEM
Women remain underrepresented in the science and engineering workforce, although to a lesser degree than in the past, with the
greatest disparities occurring in engineering, computer science, and the physical sciences
(
NSF, Science & Engineering Indicators, 2018
).
On the other hand, it has been found that as early as 13 years of age, girls have determined if they will pursue careers in STEM based on believing if they can do it. This correlates to a key developmental time in adolescence of self-confidence building and one of the reasons why STEMblazers targets middle school and high school girls with its programming. Take a look at these facts and click if you want to know more.
