The Common Ground Café provides a coffee house style café for Haverhill’s low-income and homeless residents. Located at 194 Winter Street in Haverhill’s inner-city Acre neighborhood it is an outreach of Common Ground Ministries, Inc.
The Common Ground Café was established in the fall of 2011 to fill the void in Haverhill’s inner-city Acre neighborhood when Somebody Cares New England, an outreach to the poor and homeless, transitioned to their new location at Currier Square in the Mount Washington neighborhood of Haverhill.
People can visit the café and enjoy good conversation as well as coffee in an atmosphere described as being “an oasis of comfort and acceptance.” On Saturdays, we provide breakfast and free bagged lunches.
Common Ground Café operates a Food Bank, a Clothing Outreach, and Thrift Store both located at 194 Winter Street.
Some of our activities include:
Distribution of over 16,000 pounds of food every month to families in need
We work closely with many other social agencies in Haverhill, MA
Each Christmas we celebrate the season at the Café with music and food, and distribute over 100 holiday gift bags.
We provide free weekly ESL classes Monday evenings from 6:30 to 8:00 P.M. Classes are held from September through November and January through May.
We are supported by the generous people of Haverhill and the surrounding area. We have been able to provide these benefits because of the years of the generosity of local businesses, individuals, churches, foundations, and government agencies.
The needs are great and growing but the good news is we are here working to meet those needs and bring a friendly smile, a warm cup of coffee, and a helping hand to people in need – won’t you join us?

"I was homeless for 4 years. Common Ground Café gave me a warm place to go in the winter. They helped me with clothes and food. There is hot coffee to drink. They will help with whatever they can. Just a great place!"
