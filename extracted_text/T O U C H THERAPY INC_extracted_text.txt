What is scoliosis? Mystery of our bodies: postural imbalances are caused by extremely tight soft tissues: muscles ligaments and tendons are stronger than bones of your skeleton. Muscles pull body in different directions resulting in pinched nerves, aches and pains.
Bones are strong with dense calcium yet tight muscles are stronger.
Neuromuscular Activation Therapy reduces postural imbalances.
Body aches and pain can result from accumulative movements. Symptoms may be a result repetitive motion from  sports, gym workouts and occupation.
A majority of us will have back / body pain for many reasons.  According to medial journals up to 80% of people have surgeries with  limited relief
.
Picture above on Left is
before
first session.  Picture on right is
after
first session. Note

shoulder was higher
and right leg was 2 inches
longer  After 1st session
both shoulders and
legs were equal.                   Regular clients, multi sport athletes up to pro athletes have felt amazing.  Pro athletes from 15  teams have enjoyed up to 60% faster
recovery from aches and pains and were significantly reduced.  Pro athletes have said Gene’s unique NMAT techniques exceeded the sports rehab therapy provided at their facilities

​Testimonials
Watch video: After 16 years of extreme pain from scoliosis Mika (with tears of joy) explains how she’s enjoying pain relief after 1st Neuromuscular Activation Therapy session. She had been in a body cast from age 14 to age 17 trying to correct scoliosis. At age 33 she had almost given up because no other therapy had given her relief.
