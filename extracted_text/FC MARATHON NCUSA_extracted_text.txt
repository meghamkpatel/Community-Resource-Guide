TORRY HOLT
3 B’S LEGACY LLC
Torry Holt is a bona fide North Carolinian, born in Greensboro, raised in Gibsonville and lives in Raleigh with his wife and three kids.
Torry attended North Carolina State University and was a record-setting consensus first-team All American wide receiver for the Wolfpack football team. At NCSU, Torry met his wife, a fellow student-athlete on the women’s soccer team and his life-long connection with women’s soccer began. After leaving NCSU, Torry was selected sixth overall in the 1999 NFL Draft by the St. Louis Rams. In his rookie season, Torry’s leadership and relentless work ethic was integral to the “Greatest Show on Turf’s” record breaking Super Bowl Championship season. Torry would go onto play in the NFL for over a decade racking up All-Pro nominations, Pro Bowl selections, leading the NFL in receptions and receiving yards and named to the 2000’s All Decade Team.
Never forgetting their roots and where they came from, Torry and brother Terrence (also a Wolfpack and NFL alum) teamed up once again and have been successfully operating Holt Brothers Construction and the Holt Brothers Foundation in Raleigh. For over 20 years, the Holt brother’s youthful energy, discipline, commitment to teamwork and determination has served the community with their best interest at heart.
Not one to stray too far from sports, Torry was proud to be on the Heritage Husky coaching staff for his son’s high school football team. However, it would be his two daughters and their participation in NC Courage Academy youth program that would rekindle Torry’s relationship with women’s soccer. With his son already attending NCSU, the two girls will be following mom’s footsteps and playing varsity women’s soccer for the Wolfpack.
Torry is living proof of the possibilities that involvement in youth sports can have on kids and their ability to learn life skills. “I believe my investment with the Courage is also an investment in the youth and my community. The Courage are one of the best professional soccer clubs in the world, on and off the field. The Courage principles of winning, growing the game, equity, diversity, and investing in our community are all things that I believe in. I am honored to be a part of the team.” Investing in the largest youth-to-pro club in the nation is the perfect fit for this community minded North Carolinian.
