what we
believe
THE GOOD NEWS:
As a congregation of The Lutheran ChurchâMissouri Synod (
LCMS.org
), Jesus Christ is worshiped and boldly proclaimed at St. Paul's as the Savior of the world. As Jesus so clearly stated, "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life." (John 3:16). It is through the proclamation and the hearing of this Good News that the Holy Spirit works saving faith in people (Romans 10:17). There is also great joy and thanksgiving at St. Paul's when the Holy Spirit, through the water and Word of Baptism, works in the hearts of infants, children, and adults, thus saving them (Titus 3:5).
THE FOUR CORE VALUES
we uplift at St. Paulâs â to be faithful in Christ, confident in Christ, joyful in Christ, and connected in Christ â describe us as children of God. Our vision statement, âTo be devoted followers of Jesus Christ, passionate about sharing the Gospel in word and deedâ reflects that Christ is the center of our biblical foundation.

IN COMMUNION TOGETHER:
On a weekly basis the Lord's Supper (Holy Communion) is received at St. Paul's. Here, Christ is present in a very special and promised way, offering His own body and blood, forgiveness of sins, and strength for daily living.
GROWING IN THE FAITH:
There is a recognition at St. Paul's that the faith that is begun in a new Christian needs to be nurtured through the Word of God. The pastors at St. Paul's preach sermons that explain and apply the Scripture in ways that are meaningful. An extensive program of Christian education is offered for children and adults so that all might continue to grow and mature in the Christian faith.
COMMITMENT TO QUALITY CHRISTIAN EDUCATION SINCE 1849:
An Early Childhood Center, Preschool, and Elementary School (K-8) provide students with a high-caliber academic experience, one that is grounded in the Word of God.
