Pharmacotherapies
Buprenorphine with naloxone
Buprenorphine is an opioid agonist that reduces the effects of opioid withdrawal. Naloxone rapidly reverses the effects of opioids, preventing overdose and severe withdrawal symptoms
Buprenorphine without naloxone
Buprenorphine is an opioid agonist that reduces the effects of opioid withdrawal. This helps those addicted to opioids such as fentanyl, heroin, and painkillers by easing the withdrawal process and is used in conjunction.
Buprenorphine (extended-release, injectable)
Naltrexone (oral)
Naltrexone blocks the pleasure receptors that are interacted with by alcohol and narcotics. This effectively removes any pleasurable sensations the substance offers and reduces the need to take them.
Naltrexone (extended-release, injectable)
Naltrexone blocks the pleasure receptors that are interacted with by alcohol and narcotics. This effectively removes any pleasurable sensations the substance offers and reduces the need to take them.
Medications for HIV treatment
Medications for Hepatitis C treatment
Lofexidine
Lofexidine is used to reduce the symptoms of opioid withdrawal and is primarily used in the detoxification process
Clonidine
Clonidine is used to reduce the symptoms of stimulant and opioid withdrawal and is primarily used in the detoxification process
Medications for pre-exposure to prophylaxis
Medication for mental disorders
Nicotine replacement
Treatment Approaches
Anger management
Anger is a powerful emotion and one that is often closely tied to addiction. Many people with behavioral or substance addictions will experience anger in many forms, both internally and externally. Anger management combined with other evidence based treatment can help patients control their emotions and evaluate situations without resorting to anger.
Cognitive behavioral therapy
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a commonly used type of therapy widely used in addiction treatment, rehab and recovery as a way of identifying emotional triggers that lead to substance abuse and developing methods to control them.
Contingency management/motivational incentives
Contingency management is a highly effective treatment for substance use and related disorders. These interventions have been widely tested and evaluated in the context of substance misuse treatment, and they most often involve provision of monetary-based reinforcers for submission of drug-negative urine specimens.
Motivational interviewing
Motivational Interviewing (MI) is often recommended as an evidence-based approach to behavior change and is often used in addiction treatment. MI is a more collaborative approach to therapy and requires patient and counselor to explore issues without advice, judgment, or a set path laid out.
Matrix Model
The Matrix Model provides a framework for substance abusers in treatment to achieve long-term sobriety. Patients learn about issues critical to addiction and relapse, receive direction and support from a trained therapist, and become familiar with self-help programs.
Relapse prevention
The Relapse Prevention (RP) model is widely used in alcohol and drug rehab treatments. It uses CBT practises to prepare those approaching the end of rehab treatment to begin a life of sobriety without falling into old habits of substance abuse.
Substance use disorder counseling
Substance use disorder counseling can incorporate a wide variety of therapies and and treatment models.
Telemedicine/telehealth therapy
Telehealth has grown in popularity and availability across all forms of treatment in the wake of COVID-19. For those who are unable to leave their homes (such as immunocompromised individuals) telehealth services can provide addiction treatment virtually and provide a support network for people unable to receive normal treatment.
Trauma-related counseling
Many people who have experienced trauma will turn to drugs and alcohol as a coping mechanism, which often leads to dependence and addiction. Receiving counseling for trauma in line with addiction treatment can help uncover the connection between them and learn to manage the emotional reactions to trauma that cause substance misuse.
12-step facilitation
12-step programs have been helping those suffering from alcohol and drug addictions for nearly 100 years. They offer a guided path toward recovery that is not based on rigidity but practice and self improvement. They can also provide a support network of people who empathise with and understand the challenges of addiction recovery.

Individual counseling
Individual counseling involves patients speaking with a counselor or therapist about their addiction in a one-to-one setting. This type of counseling will often incorporate different forms of behavioral therapies such as CBT in order to help the patient understand their psychological relationship with substance abuse and develop techniques to manage cravings and future temptation.
Group counseling
Group counseling can takes place in both inpatient and outpatient settings and involves those afflicted with substances use disorders/behavioral addictions meeting to discuss their issues. This form of counseling can help create a level of empathy and understanding of others journeys with addiction, which can help to give perspective on an individual's addiction. It also helps to build a support network which helps reduce relapse and promotes positive relationships outside of substance abuse.
Family counseling
Family counseling for substance use disorders and behavioral addictions helps the patient repair relationships with those close to them through open dialogue around past miss doings that were caused by addiction. This helps reestablish trust and builds a support network for the patient.
Marital/couples counseling
Addiction can be devastating to marriages and relationships. Through counseling the addict and their loved one can explore how the addiction has affected their relationship, what needs to change for things to improve, and rebuild trust.
Setting
Outpatient
Outpatient treatment centers offer the same level of care as inpatient settings while also allowing the patient to be able to return home each day
Outpatient day treatment or partial hospitalization
Outpatient day treatment or PHP requires patients to attend treatment for up to ten hours a day, most if not all days of the week while living at home.
