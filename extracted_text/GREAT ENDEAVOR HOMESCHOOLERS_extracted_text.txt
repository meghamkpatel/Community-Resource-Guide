“ Since joining GEH I have found the confidence I was missing to homeschool my wild children- just from the massive amount of support and love from the other mothers.” - Lisa K.
“I love what GEH stands for and in so many ways it has benefited us.  The boys love the friendships they have made and I am grateful to have met so many amazing women and develop new friendships myself.” - Cari V.
