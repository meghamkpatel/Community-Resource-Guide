Tree Keepers
Tree Keeper Program
Tree Keepers
“
“A tree is our most intimate contact with nature.”
”
— George Nakashima
As part our mission to preserve and create an equitable and resilient tree canopy in Durham, we rely on trained
Tree Keepers
.
WHAT ARe TREE KEEPERs?
Tree Keepers are volunteers who have accumulated the knowledge and skills to assist and serve a leadership role in volunteer tree planting and tree care activities. Tree Keepers lead small groups of volunteers, provide quality control, and teach others how to plant and care for trees.
Program partners, Keep Durham Beautiful, TreesDurham, City of Durham and Durham County Cooperative Extension, rely on Tree Keepers to plant, maintain, monitor, celebrate and protect Durham’s Tree Canopy.
Want to become a Tree Keeper?
Minimum requirements include attending two workshops: one on pruning and one on tree planting. After your training we ask that you attend at least one tree planting in that season and utilize your newfound skills to teach others the basics of tree planting care. Not only will you be a steward of the land, but you can share that joy and knowledge with people in your community!
Tree Keepers will have the opportunity to earn incentives, meet likeminded volunteers and build upon their knowledge throughout the year.
