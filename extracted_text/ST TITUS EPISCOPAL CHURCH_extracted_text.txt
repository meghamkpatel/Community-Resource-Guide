St. Titus’
is a warm, welcoming community of folks who strive to follow Jesus. Founded in 1885, we are proud of our roots as a historically Black congregation. Today we are just as proud to be a diverse community where absolutely everyone is welcome. We invite you to explore this website to learn more about us. And, when we’re able to gather in person again, we hope you will visit, either for a worship service or for one of our other activities. We’d love to have you join us on the journey.
OUR MISSION STATEMENT
St. Titus’ is a diverse and growing community committed to walking with Christ by serving others, pursuing justice and welcoming all.
OUR VISION STATEMENT
God dreams for St. Titus’ to be sacred ground where all of God’s children experience the unconditional love of Jesus. In faithful response, we will offer Spirit-filled worship where people from diverse backgrounds encounter God. As an intergenerational community, we will deepen our faith through sharing scripture, Christian tradition and our own experience. We will be open and authentic with one another, and respond to the needs of our neighbors with compassion and creativity. Our passion for God’s justice and peace will compel us to become agents for social, political, and economic transformation. St. Titus’ will be Beloved Community.

Dismantling Racism
Solidarity Statement
What happens to a dream deferred?
Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun?
Or fester like a sore—And then run?
Does it stink like rotten meat? Or crust and sugar over– like a syrupy sweet?
Maybe it just sags like a heavy load. Or does it explode?
–Langston Hughes
Racism, deeply embedded in the psyche of America, has been allowed to exist for far too long in our country. For over 400 years, People of Color have been subjected to systemic and systematic deprivation of basic human rights guaranteed by the Declaration of Independence—life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
