Tomorrow℠
DCL’s newest project is designed to improve academic preparation of young African American students with the goal of increasing their motivation and interest in STEM
(
science, technology, engineering, and math
)
school subjects and ultimately careers. Improving educational attainment has long been known to reduce poverty and improve the health of individuals, their families, and entire communities.
The Moore Biography
Aaron McDuffie Moore: African American Physician, Educator, and Founder of Durham’s Black Wall Street
is the biography of the founder of the Durham Colored Library, published in 2020 by UNC Press. DCL promotes the book through author book talks and presentations that inform the community about his important work and how his impact is still being felt throughout Durham and the state of North Carolina.
