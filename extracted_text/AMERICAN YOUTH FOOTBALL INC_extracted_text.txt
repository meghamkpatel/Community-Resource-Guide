American Youth Football & Cheer
Mission Statement
American Youth Football, Inc., established in 1996, is a support services organization, dedicated to giving back to communities by promoting the wholesome development of youth through their association with exemplary adult leaders in the sport of American football and cheer. Guidelines are established to ensure that players play in an atmosphere of learning with a competitive balance between teams.
Goals
Dedicated to teaching youth through positive role models.
Emphasis on learning, playing, and enjoying the sport while instilling high moral standards by stressing the importance of academic achievement and community involvement.
Helping kids become leaders and teammates.
Fostering confidence and a sense of self-worth, in players that extend beyond the gridiron and into the school, family and community.
To prepare youngsters to face the future with sportsmanship, teamwork, honesty, responsibility, self-discipline, positive aspirations, academic preparedness and confidence. If we teach them positive lessons, such as playing by the rules, our young athletes will learn to live by the rules.
To lend members support yet remaining NON-INTRUSIVE to local operations.

Training
AYF recommends that each member league adopt a training program for both football and cheer.  Proper training enriches the experience for players, competitors and spectators alike. AYF requires those coaches who participate in the AYF National Championship tournament to take the CDC Concussion course as well as the ASEP Football and Cheer Training courses and receive completion certificates, respectively.
AYF members are responsible for selecting and establishing the parameters for  training which are to be completed by their coaches and administrative personnel. AYF suggests that players, parents and  coaches review the course materials at
AYFcoaching.com
, produced by Human Kinetics, a leader in sports training publications, also available is the book Coaching Youth Football, written by AYF president, Joe Galat. Another great resource is the NFHS free tackle coure available

The Team
Like on the football field or cheer squad, a team that plays together wins.  We think we have the best team in youth sports.
