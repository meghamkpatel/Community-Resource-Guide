UPCOMING EVENTS
STUDIES IN BIBLE DOCTRINES!!!
We have begun the Doctrine of Christ which is being taught by Rev. James Carter. I have added a PDF document of The Doctrine of Christ, and have add the PowerPoint file which Rev. Carter is currently using during his introduction to this doctrine. You can download and print the lesson (follow the link below and it's 33 pages long), or download the actual PowerPoint file for yourself, or download and print the PowerPoint file as a PDF document. If you print I would recommend you print front and back to conserve paper. Or you can put the PDF document on your tablet or phone.
