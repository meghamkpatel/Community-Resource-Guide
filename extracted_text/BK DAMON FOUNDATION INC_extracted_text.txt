WHAT IS A PHILANTHROPIST?
A philanthropist is a person who donates time, money, experience, skills or talent to help create a better world. Anyone can be a philanthropist, regardless of status or net worth.
WHAT WE FUND
Youth Programs
At the BK Damon Foundation, we believe that our young people are not just our future but also our present.  We know that young people are capable of changing the world with support and a little guidance. Great Youth Programs are at the cornerstone of our philosophy that change is possible through philanthropy.
We Provide Scholarships to High School Students
With the rising cost of education its becoming more and more challenging for talented students to attend college.  We believe that every child should have an opportunity to attend college if thatâs the path they choose. We know that our belief in a young personâs success is just as important as the tangible gift that they will receive.
Missions
Missions work is at the heart of our philanthropy.  The BK Damon Fund has supported missions work across the globe and domestically since our inception. We understand that missions work takes place in many forms.  We support individuals and organizations that make sacrifices for the good of humanity. Missions work provides a great return on our investment.xt box. Click again or double click to start editing the text.

OUR SUCCESS STORIES
When I started the Youth Leadership Program you met a worried child with a deep drive to succeed. You gave me the motivation to move forward and continue achieving great things. I cannot comprehend how my life has changed in the past couple of months. It seemed just yesterday, I was crying at the thought of not having a future. I want to thank you for believing in me during a time in my life where I had no sight of the future.

OUR SUCCESS STORIES
Thank you for the opportunity to reflect and write about the program! My name is Mia and I participated in the Youth Leadership program. As I reflect on the impact the program has had on my life, it was the beginning of my transformation into an adult. Prior to beginning the Youth Leadership program, I did not know what career I wanted to pursue. However, through various teachings and panels I discovered my passion. This program will always hold an important place in my heart and I am very grateful for the impact it has had on my life.
