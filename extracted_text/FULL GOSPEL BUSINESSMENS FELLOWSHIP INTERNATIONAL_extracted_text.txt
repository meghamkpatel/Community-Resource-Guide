Welcome!
Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship International (FGBMFI) is one of the largest networks of Christian Businessmen in the world. Founded in 1952, we are in over 80 nations - meeting in thousands of chapters.
​
FGBMFI's primary strategy is executed on the local level; yet the organization is global in scope and reach. Designed to be a grass roots movement, the structure of our organization purposefully attempts to push resources to the local level - equipping the member to impact his or her local community or city.
