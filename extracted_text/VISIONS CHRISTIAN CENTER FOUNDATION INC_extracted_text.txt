Committed to Community
Visions Cares celebrates all we do to help make our communities and each other better. It’s a promise to invest in people.
Visions is about people, not profits. As a credit union, giving back is what we do.
Visions supports hundreds of causes in many different ways. Grants and donations fund good works. Employee volunteers pay it forward. Sponsorships support community events. Acts of kindness make people’s days brighter.
Every year, we donate
over $1 million
to causes and organizations throughout our communities. Our employees donate thousands of hours of their time too, volunteering for causes that matter to them. We sponsor the things that make our communities great, from fundraising walks to arts festivals. Dozens of acts of kindness range from picking up the tab for strangers at a local coffee shop to providing care packages to patients in the hospital or even an umbrella on a rainy day.
$
Invested in our communities – and counting.
Change the way you think about banking and make change in your community. You can be a part of our movement to make an impact.

Grants
Grants are donations tied to a specific project that have a measurable impact on the organization or community. Organizations request grants to cover specific programming, pieces of equipment that enhance their provided services, and more.
About Grants

Sponsorships
Sponsorships can range from being the title sponsor of a cooking competition benefiting a local food bank to a program ad for the high school musical. The funds raised tend to help support an organization’s general fund, or “bottom line.” We sponsor events covering many causes across all of our regions.
About Sponsorships

In Kind
It’s not always money that’s needed to make a community event memorable. Visions can also help provide the finishing touches with donated items such as pens, water bottles, gift cards, and more.

Employee Giveback
The Community Impact Program allows employees to log their volunteer hours — for all events, not just those sponsored by Visions — and then earn rewards based on their participation hours. Employees routinely donate more than 3,000 hours in a year!
About Volunteering
Need Volunteers?
Special Programs
Our give back goes beyond what we donate, sponsor, or volunteer for. We’re proud to recognize key members of the community with programs tailored to their unique service and needs.
Educators
We love educators and the role they play in raising and caring for our youth. That’s why we created the Visions Loves Educators program to thank them for all they do! Whether it’s rewarding them with grants and bonus coupons or coming into their classroom to help educate on financial wellness, we support educators.
Educators Program
Veterans
Veterans hold a special place in our community, and we want to thank them for their service. We couldn’t do what we do without their sacrifice, which is why we created our Veterans Program as a special way of giving back.

Kindness
Not only do we strive to be better, but we want to make you feel better, too! From acts of kindness to our annual “Family Day” event at our headquarters, we love to show our kindness and enable yours in a number of ways.
