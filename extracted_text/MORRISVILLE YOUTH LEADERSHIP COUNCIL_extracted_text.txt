Morrisville Youth Leadership Council
ABOUT US
Who are we?
Morrisville Youth Leadership Council is a
501c3 licensed non-profit organization in partnership with the Town of Morrisville that promotes leadership and service within the Morrisville Youth community through volunteering events that have a substantial impact within the community.
​History
MYLC was founded in 2013 after Akhila B. approached the Mayor of Morrisville with an ambition to get youth more involved in the community. The Mayor loved her idea, and Akhila, along with a group of youth, started this council to promote leadership and service among their peers in Morrisville. MYLC officially partnered with the Town of Morrisville in 2017.
The Mission
The mission of MYLC is to help local youth develop leadership skills and civic engagement by representing the views of the local youth to the Morrisville Town Council, providing opportunities for experience with the local government process, partaking in
volunteering and community events, all while practicing proper parliamentary procedure.
Events
MYLC always aspires to promote events with a direct impact on our community, the individuals around us, and movements our members are passionate about. From time to time we like to host fundraising events, in which we raise money and awareness for charities in our area! If you would like to suggest an event, let us know at the bottom of our event page.
Our Vision
Our goal is to have 100 members and 50 annual events in another 2 years, and to gain recognition from other towns, organizations, and North Carolina. Our top priority is to provide impactful events to our members right now, and we are constantly looking for opportunities to do so.
