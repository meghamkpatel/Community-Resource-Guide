People of Faith Against the Death Penalty
People of Faith Against the Death Penalty (PFADP) is a nongovernmental organisation whose mission is to educate and mobilise faith communities to act to abolish the death penalty in the United States. Founded in 1994 in North Carolina, PFADP focuses its programs on organising among faith communities in the Southern United States, where most executions in the United States happen.
PFADP’s members include Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, and people from other faith traditions. PFADP was founded on a vision of promoting the ethic of restorative justice, seeking to address the needs of the community, victims and offenders. FADP has organised hundreds of community forums and special events on the death penalty. PFADP’s NC Moratorium Now campaign led to more than 1,000 North Carolina churches, businesses, and congregations passing resolutions for a moratorium on executions, including resolutions by 39 local governments.
This campaign also led to the NC Senate becoming the first legislative body in the American South to call for a temporary halt to executions. PFADP’s work is supported by individual member contributions and donations from congregations. PFADP is proud to be a member of the World Coalition against the death penalty and encourages World Coalition members to become involved in PFADP’s efforts in the Southern United States.
