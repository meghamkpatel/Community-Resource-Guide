Vajradhatu
was the name of the umbrella organization of
Chögyam Trungpa
Rinpoche, one of the first
Tibetan Buddhist
lamas
to visit and teach in the West. It served as the vehicle for the promulgation of his teachings, and was also the name by which his community was known from 1973 until 1990.  Starting in 1976 it was paralleled by a governmental structure for establishing the non-denominational enlightened society of
Shambhala
Kingdom, which included
Shambhala Training
among many other activities. In February 2000, the Vajradhatu organization was renamed
Shambhala International
by
Sakyong Mipham
Rinpoche.
History
[
edit
]
Foundation by Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche
[
edit
]
The community of Chögyam Trungpa originated in 1970 with his arrival in North America from Scotland. The first established center of his teachings was "Tail of the Tiger" in
Barnet, Vermont
(now
Karmê Chöling
). When he began teaching at
University of Colorado Boulder
in 1971, a second branch of the community began to form there. When Vajradhatu was incorporated in Colorado in 1973, it consolidated Tail of the Tiger,
Rocky Mountain Dharma Center
, a retreat facility in the
Rocky Mountains
in Colorado; and Karma Dzong, an urban meditation center in
Boulder
. The organization grew to include Gampo Abbey in
Nova Scotia
and dozens of smaller meditation centers called Dharmadhatus in cities around the US,
Canada
and later in Europe.
In the early 1970s the community grew rapidly and attracted the involvement of such notables as
Allen Ginsberg
,
Anne Waldman
, and many others. As the decade wore on, the
hippies
and sixties
counterculture
members who comprised the large part of the membership were asked by Trungpa to experiment with more formal modes of behavior, attire, address, and societal expressions in general.
In 1972 Trungpa had identified Thomas F. Rich, an American with Buddhist name
Ösel Tendzin
, as his
dharma heir
, and in a formal ceremony on August 22, 1976, Trungpa appointed Rich as Dorje Gyaltsap, Vajra Regent and Director of the First Class of Vajradhatu. As described in the 1977 article in "Garuda V", which also reproduces the proclamation (signed by Trungpa XI and the 16th Karmapa, Trungpa empowered Thomas Rich "as his regent and as a holder of the Kagyu and Nyingma lineages". Trungpa further stated "There is the possibility that members of the sangha, Western people, can take over from the Tibetans".
Vajradhatu hosted visits by
Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa
, head of the
Kagyu
, in 1974,
Khyentse Norbu
, head of the
Nyingma
, in 1976, and the
14th Dalai Lama
in 1981. In 1976 Trungpa Rinpoche began his cycle of Shambhala teachings and, with his students, manifesting forms of Shambhala society.  In 1986 he moved the international headquarters of Vajradhatu to
Halifax, Nova Scotia
, where he died the following year. A large number of his disciples emigrated from the United States to Nova Scotia along with him.
Leadership by Ösel Tendzin
[
edit
]
In 1987, one year after moving the organization to Nova Scotia, Trungpa Rinpoche died of illnesses related to long-term alcohol abuse.
[1]
He was 47. Following Trungpa's death, senior Kagyu lineage holder
Tai Situpa
recommended that he himself take over leadership of Vajradhatu in conjunction with Trungpa's half brother,
Damchu Tenphel
, who resided in Tibet.
[2]
Tendzin, Trungpa's appointed successor, declined the offer and assumed leadership of the organization.
In December 1988, the community learned Tendzin had passed
HIV
to a male partner in the Colorado congregation, who in turn unknowingly infected his female partner.
[3]
Tendzin, who was HIV-positive, knowingly had sex with students for three years without disclosing his infection, believing that his spiritual practice protected himself and others from AIDS.
[4]
Tendzin acted as spiritual head of Vajradhatu until his own death in 1990 of
HIV/AIDS
, amid controversy over admissions that he had unprotected sex with students while knowing he was HIV+. Ösel Tendzin infected at least one male student with HIV; the young man later died of AIDS.
[5]
[4]
It eventually came out that the Vajradhatu board of directors had known of the problem for more than two years and had done nothing about it.
[6]
Transition to Shambhala International
[
edit
]
Following Tendzin's death, Trungpa's eldest son Ösel Rangdröl Mukpo, now known as
Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche
, assumed spiritual and executive leadership of Vajradhatu. The community had been deeply divided and in distress over the events surrounding Ösel Tendzin's death, and repeatedly turned to the elder statesmen of the Kagyu and Nyingma lineages for guidance.
[7]
The succession of Ösel Rangdröl was approved by the heads of both the Kagyu and Nyingma lineages, who encouraged the community to persevere.
Jamgön Kongtrül
the third, one of the four regents of the
Karma Kagyu
lineage in the period when the Karmapa had yet to be recognized, issued a statement that "His Holiness [Dilgo Khenstse Rinpoche, head of the Nyingma lineage and the Sawang's teacher] and the Kagyu lineage holders are all in agreement that the Sawang Ösel Rangdröl Mukpo should become the lineage holder of Vajradhatu."
[8]
In February 2000, restated articles of incorporation were signed, officially changing the name from Vajradhatu to
Shambhala International
. The change of name, which began informally with the Sakyong Mipham's assumption of leadership in 1990, reflected his approach of integrating the Shambhala teachings within Buddhism and making them the unifying principle of a Shambhala Buddhist sangha.
[9]
This transition enabled the organization to avoid lawsuits and consequent financial ruin.

Karmê Chöling
[

Main article:
Karmê Chöling
In 1970, Karmê Chöling was founded in Barnet, Vermont by the Vidyadhara, (literally meaning “awareness holder;” a spiritual leader of Buddhism)
[11]
Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche
. Karmê Chöling is the first teaching seat in North America of Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, a 20th-century Buddhist meditation master that was credited with bringing Buddhism to the western world.
[12]
Originally a dairy farm, the building was purchased by Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche’s students and was converted under his supervision into a Shambhala Buddhist retreat center. It was called “Tail of the Tiger”, but in 1974 the name was changed to Karmê Chöling, which remains its name today.
[12]
Rocky Mountain Dharma Center
[
edit
]
The
Rocky Mountain Dharma Center
was founded by
Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche
in 1971 at
Red Feather Lakes, Colorado
.
[13]
It was located on 600 acres in a valley in the northern Colorado Rockies.
After the death of Ösel Tendzin in 1990, Trungpa's son,
Ösel Rangdröl Mukpo
became head of the organization. In 1995, Ösel Rangdröl Mukpo was enthroned as Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche, a chögyal, or "dharma king," who holds and propagates the teachings of Shambhala. The name of Rocky Mountain Dharma center was changed to
Rocky Mountain Shambhala Center
sometime
[
when?
]
in the 1990s.

In 2000, after Sakyong Mipham started the process of enclosing the previously secular teachings of Shambhala within the container of a new Buddhist lineage, Shambhala Buddhism, the retreat center was incorporated separately from Shambhala International as a 501c3 educational non-profit named
Shambhala Mountain Center
. The new center was independent of Shambhala International with limited oversight from the Sakyong Potrang, an organization representing Sakyong Mipham.
[14]
In September 2020, an investigative report detailed several incidents of sexual harm that had taken place at Rocky Mountain Dharma Center.
