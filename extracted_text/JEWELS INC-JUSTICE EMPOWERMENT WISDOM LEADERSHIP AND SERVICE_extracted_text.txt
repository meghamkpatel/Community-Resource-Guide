J.E.W.E.L.S., Inc. At A Glance
Jailen Route - Cohort 1 - NC A&T Chapter
"J.E.W.E.L.S. has created a space that emphasizes the importance of community not only within the organization its self, but in the service we do. Being apart of this organization has brought me genuine friendships, learning opportunities, and has helped me continue develop as a leader. As a collective we know that J.E.W.E.L.S., it’s bigger than us and to be apart of an organization that promotes and prioritizes positive influence on those that surrounds us speaks volumes."
Brianna Brown- Cohort 1 - NCCU Chapter
"Since becoming a member of the J.E.W.E.L.S. organization in 2019, becoming a better leader has been instilled within me. I have had the pleasure of networking and learning through so many people. It was also a pleasure to serve as the FIRST Vice President of this illustrious organization. To be a member of this group means that you share a common goal with other like-minded women to be an advocate for the voiceless and give back a greater good to the community. This organization brings so much life and happiness to me. I am forever grateful for our founders, my sisters, and all of the hard work that is soon to come."
Daisha Ingram - Cohort 3 - NCCU Chapter
