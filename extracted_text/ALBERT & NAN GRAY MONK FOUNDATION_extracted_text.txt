Since introducing Albert, I have noticed a significant change in student performance in all of my classes. My students are now better prepared for each lesson, which I attribute to the explanations Albert provides. I also use it to reflect on my teaching and provide extra support in areas my students struggle with.

Before using Albert it was impossible to give my 150 students feedback in a timely manner. Now, not only do my students know if they are right or wrong instantly, but the explanations help them not make the same mistake twice. I have seen an enormous improvement with my Calculus students by using Albert over a traditional book!

Albert contributed to the success of my students as it allowed them to review concepts according to difficulty level and work independently. Lower performing students were not discouraged from using the platform because there were still questions that they could complete. I believe the extra practice was the difference for students scoring well.

My first time using Albert was when I wasn’t even in class and needed a sub. When I came back to school, my students were unanimously excited about how helpful Albert was. The fact they had a strong positive reaction to it when I wasn’t even there to facilitate their first assignment says a lot!

I started using Albert a few years ago and constantly hear from my students on how well it prepares them for the actual exam. There is a direct correlation between the scores my students make on the exams and the amount of time they devote to practice with Albert. The more Albert they do, the better they score.
