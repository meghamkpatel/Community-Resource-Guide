Fitness and Bodybuilding from a Christian Perspective.
Question
Hello brothers and sisters, I have a series of questions surrounding physical fitness and how that relates to matters of faith. These questions are specifically directed to believers who have wrestled with this topic before in relation to their own fitness and faith journeys.
I am a young man who enjoys the physical and mental challenges and victories of fitness (and in some ways bodybuilding). However, as a Christian, I am continually trying to "take every thought captive" (2 Cor. 10:5). I've done some research into how physical fitness can relate to faith and have found a few broad truths.
Examine your motives. Why are you devoting time to this. Are you trying to stay healthy, or attract attention from others?
Vanity is a sin. Stay away from it, especially if you find yourself fixated on a certain exercise or muscle group.
Steroid use is a sin. (No push-back from me here. Steroids are not for me.)
A few questions (more practical in nature) I have are this:
What wisdom do other physically fit Christians have to share? What is your perspective and mindset?
Could an argument be made that bodybuilding and fitness is a way of glorifying God by helping his creation (the human body) reach its full potential?
Speaking in a very down-to-earth way, what media should a Christian be consuming during a workout? I enjoy secular music during my workouts because of its motivating qualities, however, that motivation is often based out of rage, anger, pride etc..., things that motivated me as an un-saved person.  As any gym-goer knows, the success of. a workout depends primarily on your mental headspace. What emotions can a Christian use to fuel workouts, if not ungodly motivators? Could anger at sin be a healthy motivator? Very open to suggestions!!
