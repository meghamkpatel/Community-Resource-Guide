UR Restored Ministries
Inc. is a Faith-Based, 501c3 tax-exempt, non-profit organization that comes alongside all those impacted by incarceration. We stimulate human services, therapeutic relief, bring God’s restorative love and seek to eliminate racial disparities in incarceration and those impacted from it. We focus on providing services to those inside, recently released, youth and the families. We address criminal justice reform, provide trainings, educational support and resources that aids in eliminating recidivism. Our reentry services, career development and programs inside the prison and outside assist in changing the narrative of those impacted by incarceration and contributes to restoring lives. Across this Nation, we are Restoring Lives.

The incarceration of a parent  can have a tremendous impact on the course of a child's life. Check out how we support youth in education and extracurricular activities.
The Families and communities of individuals that are
incarcerated,
are impacted as well. They need help in supporting their family member(s) inside and help in supporting themselves with the individual being absent.
While the men and women are incarcerated they need supportive, reentry programs that will help them in a holistic way.  We help in providing transportation and with housing.
