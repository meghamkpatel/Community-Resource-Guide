BIBLE STUDY TOPIC
The Sunday morning Christian Coffee Chat class plans to spend 5 Sundays (April 21-May 19) reading and discussing the Biblical passages that are often used to condemn homosexuality and exclude LGBTQIA+ folks from full participation in the church. We will use material that the ELCA published several years ago.  The resources remain relevant to todayâs continued dis
cussions of hospitality and welcome like this â
Background Essay on Biblical Texts
â by Arland J. Hultgren and Walter
F. Taylor Jr.
The
Reconciling in Christ (RIC)
journey to be fully inclusive of
all
of God's children, especially the LGBTQIA+ community, begins with a more robust
18-month process
than this important 5 week Bible Study.  CVLC members have expressed interest in starting the RIC journey, but we have yet to officially begin.
God's mission for CVLC remains "fearlessly trusting God, we accept
all
others, ourselves, and our calling to give comfort."

Fearlessly trusting God
, we accept all others, ourselves, and our calling to
give comfort
.
Comfort your family by writing down your funeral wishes;
comfort your church by leaving CVLC in your will.
I have worked with numerous families over the years as they plan their loved one's funeral.  The families that knew what their loved one wanted do so much better than those who do not know.  Give comfort to your family by writing down your wishes and sharing it with them.  In the same way, you will give comfort to your church by leaving a legacy gift for CVLC in your will.
