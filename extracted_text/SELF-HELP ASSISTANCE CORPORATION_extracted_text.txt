Get the Help You Need Paying Your Heating Bills
13,233 households were warmer last winter because of help received from Self Help, Inc. and the
Home Energy Assistance Program
. We want residents throughout our service areas to know that Home Energy Assistance can lower their heating bills through discounts and savings options of the Low-income Home Energy Assistance Program and Heating Emergency Assistance Retrofit Task Weatherization Assistance Program (HEARTWAP) administered by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
UPDATES
The
Client Portal
for both new and returning clients will be available on October 1, 2023
Those who qualify can also benefit from discounts on utility bills. Over a 12-month period, this can mean big savings to a household. Self Help is out to make sure more people know about home energy assistance, discount rates, and energy efficiency. Households that participate in the Home Energy Assistance program are automatically enrolled in energy discount rates from utility companies.
Home Energy Assistance works closely with the Weatherization and HEART-WAP programs to coordinate eligibility efforts. This allows for additional assistance to clients who have used up their Home Energy Assistance benefits.
Self Help
works with volunteer agencies within our service area to provide trained volunteers to take applications within the community, thereby making access to Home Energy Assistance more convenient, especially for the senior citizens within each community.
Locations
Currently, Self Help Home Energy Assistance and Energy Conservation programs serves residents in 26 different cities and towns in Massachusetts.
