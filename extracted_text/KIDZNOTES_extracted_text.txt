“I donate to this program because I know how much I benefited from beginning early with violin lessons.
I still play in a community orchestra
in Chapel Hill and couldn’t live
without it at the ripe old age of 73.”
— Harriet, donor
“The greatest value Kidznotes offers is the community and socialization experienced while learning about music and how to play an instrument. It is beautiful to witness everyone learning and connecting through the international language of music. It is Very special.”
— Michael, parent
“Kidznotes creates a diverse community dedicated to lifting each other up in rigorous musical learning and enjoyment. That community is a treasure.”
— Elaine, parent
