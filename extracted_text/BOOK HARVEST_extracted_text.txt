The Opportunity
Eighty percent of brain development happens in the first three years of life. Imagine the possibilities for all children when they grow up surrounded by books and stories, words and ideas — starting at birth.
​
It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
More Info
Our Response
We nourish young brains by filling their worlds with an abundance of books. And we partner with parents from the time their children are born, to ensure that parents are equipped with everything they need to help their children thrive.
​
It’s a response that fuels imagination and sparks joy.
More Info
Our Impact
More than 2,000,000 Book Harvest books have been harvested by children since 2011. Books are the catalyst for robust vocabularies, empathy, curiosity, and creativity – and the foundation for a lifelong love of reading.
​
It’s an impact that is transforming lives, book by book.
More Info
We love that there is actually structured guidance for teaching our child to read, and the basic foundations of literacy, in addition to getting the tools (books) to do it with.
