Become a Business Sponsor
It's Good For Your Community and Your Bottom Line.
Reach a discerning and significant audience of listeners throughout the Omaha-Council Bluffs area.
An association with KIOS-FM with its long-standing reputation for social responsibility identifies your company as a civic and community-minded organization with an interest in the public that goes beyond simply selling a product or service.
Why It’s the Best Decision You’ll Make Today:
1.
Audience
Influential. Intelligent. Decision Makers.
Around 60,000 weekly listeners trust KIOS as their source for news, jazz and much more. They're well-educated, affluent, and business-savvy, more likely to own homes and businesses, and they appreciate our underwriters' straightforward, non-commercial approach.
2.
Environment
Don't get lost in a sea of commercials. We don't air any. In fact, we don't air more than two 20-second underwriting announcements per break.
3.
Relationship
Your underwriting investment signifies that you are a civic and community-minded business that cares about quality products.  80% of public radio listeners say that their opinion of a company is more positive when they find out it supports public radio. 85% of listeners consider NPR "personally important to them."  77% of listeners take action in response to an NPR sponsorship announcement.  87% of listeners discuss content with family, friends and colleagues. **
To learn more, call (531) 299-9290 or email  underwriting@kios.org.
