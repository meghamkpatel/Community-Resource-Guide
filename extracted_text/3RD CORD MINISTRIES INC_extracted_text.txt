THE 3 STRAND CORD
Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken. (Ecclesiastes 4:12, NIV)
Doctrinal Statement
We believe in the verbal inspiration, inerrancy, and plenary authority of both the Old and New Testaments of the Bible and that it is the only rule of faith and practice.
(II Timothy 3:16-17)
We believe in the triune God
(the Trinity)
:
Father
(Genesis 1:1)
;
Son
(John 1:1-3, 14 & 10:30)
;
Holy Spirit
(John 4:24; Matthew 28:19)
.
We believe in the virgin birth and the deity of Jesus Christ.
(Luke 1:34-35; Colossians 2:9)
We believe the Holy Spirit is the Person who convicts the world of sin, and regenerates, indwells, enlightens, and guides the believer.
(John 16:7-8; I Corinthians 3:16)
We believe in the death, burial, bodily resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ, and His Lordship.
(Acts 2:32; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4; Philippians 2:9-11)
We believe in the personal return of our Lord Jesus Christ and the bodily resurrection of humanity.
(Acts 1:11; 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17; Revelation 20:11-15)
We believe in the depravity of all humanity and their lost condition by nature.
(Romans 3:19, 23)
We believe in the shed blood of Jesus Christ as the only atonement for sins.
(Romans 3:25; Hebrews 9:22)
We believe humanity can only be justified before God by grace through faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ.
(Acts 13:38-39; Ephesians 2:8-9; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4)
We believe in the eternal, conscious punishment of all unsaved humanity.
(Rev. 20:11-15)
We believe those who receive Jesus Christ as Savior may have full assurance of their salvation based on the promises of Scripture. Additionally, true saints will persevere.
(John 10:28-29)
We believe all true believers in Jesus Christ are members of the body of Christ, the Church.
(1 Corinthians 12:12-13)
We believe all believers are called into a life of personal holiness, including separation from sinful practices.
(James 4:4; Romans 12:1-2; 1 John 2:15-17; 1 Peter 1:15-16)
We believe all true followers of Christ should be baptized and participate in the ordinance of communion
.
(Matthew 28:19; Acts 2:41, 8:26-28; Colossians 2:12; I Corinthians 11:23-30)
We believe in the personality of Satan and his present work in this world.
(Job 1:6-7)
We believe followers of Christ are commissioned to make disciples through the proclamation of the Gospel by deed and word to all the world.
(Matthew 28:19-20; Acts 1:8)
We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit by whose indwelling and baptism, occurring at the moment of salvation, the Christian is enabled to live a godly life through the Holy Spirit's continual filling (control) as a result of obedience to the Word. Every Spirit-filled Christian will demonstrate the fruit of the Holy Spirit and utilize his spiritual gifts under submission to the church leaders according to Biblical principles.
(John 14:21, 16:7-8; I Corinthians 1:7, 12:13, 14:22, 32:40; Galatians 5:22-23; Ephesians 5:18; I Peter 4:10).
