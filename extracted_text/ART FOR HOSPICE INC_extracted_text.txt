Art for Hospice is a non-profit designed to share art created by students with individuals suffering from debilitating conditions. The organization began in 2008 as a community service project by a 6th grader in Durham, NC. Since that time, Art for Hospice has sponsored the donation of 5000+ pieces of artÂ  across the nation.
