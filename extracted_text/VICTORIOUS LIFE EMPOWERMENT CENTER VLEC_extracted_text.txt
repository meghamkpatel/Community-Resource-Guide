PASTOR
ChristopherD.
Collier
After graduating from High School, he moved to Kansas City, MO, where he attended and  received his Bachelor of Arts Degree in Jazz & Performance from the University of Missouri - Kansas City Conservatory. During his stay in Kansas City, he attended then Christ Temple  Church, now called Victorious Life Church, where the pastor is Bishop Mark C. Tolbert. In  1992, God called Elder Collier into ministry, ever since that day, God has continued to work in his life.
In 1996, Elder Collier found a “good thing” and obtained favor from the Lord by marrying Sister Le’Rhonda (Mimms) Collier. They now share the joy of two beautiful daughters Jazzmine Sy’less and Alyssa Christine.
God has richly blessed District Elder Collier in the gospel music industry; he has recorded and played with some of the best; Thompson Community Choir, Chuck Smith, Kim Burrell, Joy Unlimited, Mark Hubbard and Dwayne Woods. He also served as Vice President and producer of Shakin’ the Mountain Productions, which has produced several album projects.
District Elder Collier has many accomplishments; preaching, musical collaborations with various gospel artists, and community projects. He has served on many city, regional, and national level offices, even working on the national level of the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World Inc, where he served two full terms as the IPYPU (International Pentecostal Young Peoples Union) President.
In 2011, God called District Elder Collier to return back home to St Louis to become the founder and Senior Pastor of the New Life Empowerment Center, now known as New Life Empowerment Church. God continuously blessed the seeds planted in this tillage ground. Many families (in some numbers of over 150 families) joined and more than 1200 guests and visitors came through the doors of “NLEC” during his Pastorship with over 156 souls being baptized in Jesus name and many were healed, delivered, and set free.
In 2015, God blessed District Elder Collier with the vision and plan to purchase the building sitting on more than 3 acres of land where “NLEC” now worships in, located at 6401 Stratford Ave in St Louis, MO.
In 2017, District Elder Collier accepted the call to return back to Kansas City, Missouri to assist his Father in the gospel Bishop Mark C. Tolbert as his Executive Pastor of Operations. District Elder Collier gives God all of the glory for the things He has done and continues to do.
​
District Elder Collier was installed as Pastor of Victorious Life Church on July 11, 2021. He gives God all of the glory for the things He has done and continues to do.
