We acknowledge that we are situated on the unceded homelands of the Moh-He-Con-Nuck, the Peoples of the Waters that Are Never Still.
We recognize that this land and its people are timeless and pay honor and respect to this history and to the Elders—past, present, and future.
We advocate for the autonomy of the Moh-He-Con-Nuck, today the
Stockbridge-Munsee Community
, and support sovereignty in their homelands.
