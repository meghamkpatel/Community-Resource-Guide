Where merciful hearts and helping hands unite!
Our
Working Mission
is to restore self-worth, dignity, and pride to those in need through education, training, and career development!
Our
Vision
is to strengthen those in need as they pursue positive social change and improved quality of life!
We believe that by providing basic primary items
(food, clothing, hygiene items, school supplies)
to those experiencing socio-economic challenges
(poverty, homelessness, displacement, trauma, domestic violence, anxieties, injury, relocation, etc.);
we can help restore, educate, and empower those in need. Earnest Heart Foundation is also equipped to offer mentoring, tutoring, and job readiness skills, and training to improve families and an individual’s overall quality of life.
Our mission is to restore, educate, and empower men, women, and children as they pursue self-sufficiency, and self-efficacy.
