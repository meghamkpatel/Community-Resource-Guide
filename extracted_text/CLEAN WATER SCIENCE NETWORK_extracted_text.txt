Clean Water Science Network
Our mission is to improve the health and quality of life of developing communities through educational outreach, fundamental scientific studies, and applied research projects focused on water and sanitation issues.
Millions of people around the globe lack a safe and reliable supply of drinking water
​Since challenges faced by developing communities are best understood by those who live them daily, we strongly believe that the best way to encourage change is to
build capacity at a local level
. Many remarkable organizations exist to facilitate development projects, but few educational opportunities focused on the fundamentals of water and sanitation sciences are available to those with limited experience. ​We aim to fill this gap via programs targeted to
empower the community members
with the tools to improve their quality of life.
2024 CWSN Enrichment Fellowship
Clean Water Science Network Enrichment Fellowship recognizes highly engaged and enthusiastic mentees. CWSN Enrichment fellowship supports CWSN mentees to provide funding for a community-based project, graduate school preparation (e.g., GRE or TOEFL classes), graduate application, or any other academic activity.
The program is limited to
current participants (2023/2024 cohort)  in the CWSN Mentorship program
.
The application is due
April 30th, 2024
. This year, we will be awarding three $500 USD fellowships.
The application is closed. Stay tuned for the announcement of the winners.
