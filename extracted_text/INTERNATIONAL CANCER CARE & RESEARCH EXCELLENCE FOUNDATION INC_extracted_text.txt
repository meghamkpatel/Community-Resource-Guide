Mount Sinai’s Tisch Cancer Institute is pleased to welcome international patients seeking cancer treatment in the United States with the most advanced therapies and clinical trials available. Through the Derald H. Ruttenberg Treatment Center (an ambulatory outpatient treatment facility) and the Dubin Breast Center (a center dedicated to comprehensive breast cancer care), Mount Sinai provides patients with a multidisciplinary medical team skilled in personalizing the most effective treatment plan for each patient.
Our specialized oncology team—which includes medical oncologists, surgeons, nursing staff, nutritionists, and social workers—is part of a larger medical center team that works together to provide each patient with the most comprehensive and effective care possible. Mount Sinai is also able to offer patients emerging treatment options available through clinical trial enrollments.
Providing Advanced Cancer Treatments
The Tisch Cancer Institute serves patients from around the world seeking international cancer treatments in areas that include the following:
Brain
Breast
Colorectal
Esophagus
Gynecologic (cervix, ovarian, and uterine)
Kidney
Liver
Lung
Pancreas
Prostate
Skin
Stomach
Catering to Our International Clientele
Mount Sinai strives to provide the most convenient and comfortable experience possible for our international cancer patients. In addition to the hospitality services Mount Sinai offers (which include translation services and premium patient rooms), the Tisch Cancer Institute creates a supportive environment for both patients and family members.
While most of our current clientele travels from areas including the Middle East and South America seeking specialized oncologic surgeries and radiation therapy (such as stereotactic radiotherapy), we welcome patients from any location looking for the highest quality cancer treatment abroad.
Mount Sinai’s goal for our international cancer patients is to provide the best possible treatment and overall experience, and to make sure our patients from abroad receive a level of care not available anywhere else.
