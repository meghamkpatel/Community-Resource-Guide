Who we are
We are the
Bahá'ís of County Durham (England, UK) and we welcome you to our website.  We are also part of a wider North East Bah
á'í community and enjoy regular meetings for prayer, study, consultation and reflection on both our own spiritual lives and service to the communities in which we live.  This website shares information about our activities and we welcome you to these activities, which are open to everyone regardless of your beliefs, as well as links to more in-depth information about the Bahá'í Faith and its Sacred Writings.
What we do
In addition to a range of meetings and annual celebrations, Bahá’í communities around the world provide spaces and training opportunities for people of all ages to come together to read, study and reflect upon their spiritual nature.  These activities are open to all people.
Devotional Gatherings:
Devotional gatherings allow individuals to carry out collective worship in diverse settings, uniting with others in prayer, awakening spiritual susceptibilities, and shaping a pattern of life distinguished for its devotional character.
Youth & Adult
Study Circles:
Circles of study, open to all, enable people of varied backgrounds to advance on an equal footing and explore the application of the Bahá'í teachings to their lives and to the betterment of their communities.  The participants learn to see themselves as protagonists in their constant effort to apply knowledge to effect individual and collective transformation.
Children’s Classes:
Tending to the needs of the children in a neighbourhood, these classes offer children lessons that develop their spiritual faculties and lay the foundation of a noble and upright character.  They help children learn to think, reflect and apply spiritual principles in their lives and society.
Junior Youth Empowerment Programme:
The programme assists junior youth to navigate through a crucial stage of their lives and to become empowered to direct their energies towards the advancement of civilization. Junior youth groups help their participants to form a strong moral identity in their early adolescent years and to contribute to the well-being of their communities.
What we believe
Bahá'ís believe that Baha'u'llah is the promised One of all ages and the latest in a long line of Messagers from God
who taught that:
All humanity is one family.
Women and men are equal.
All prejudice – racial,
religious, national, or economic – is destructive and must be overcome.
We must investigate truth for
o
urselves, without
p
reconceptions.
Science and religion are in harmony.
Our economic problems are linked to spiritual problems.
The family and its unity are
v
ery important.
There is one God.
All major religions come from God.
World peace is the crying
need for our time.
