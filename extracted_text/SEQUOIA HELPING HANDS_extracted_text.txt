Non-Profit Devoted to AIDS Orphans of Kenya Africa | Sequoia Helping Hands
A widow gets her new house!
Sequoia Helping Hands is a unique non-profit organization
		    where 100% of your individual donations goes to those who
		    are in need. Sequoia was born out of the desire to help
		    the many orphaned and vulnerable children left behind
		    as a result of their parents succumbing to HIV/AIDS and
		    Malaria. Sequoia Helping Hands keeps children off the
		    streets by providing a safe place for them to nurture and grow.
"Sequoia Helping Hands" was formally incorporated
		    in the US as a non-profit organization in 2003. However,
		    work by the founder, Juni Asiyo and other members of the
		    organization have been going on for many years.
