Our Mission is to be
a
church of the Great Command,
the Great Commission and the Great
Tradition.
We
obey
God's
Great Command
.
We fulfill
the
Great Commission
through developing
life-long disciples of Christ
through baptism and our Family Formation programs.
We
live
out
the
Great Tradition
by
doing to what the Bible says according to the teaching
of the Early and
Undivided Church, according to the Seven Ecumenical Councils.
Welcome to Christ the redeemer!
What to expect on sundays @CTR...
There
are two basic things you will want to know about our worship service.
FIRST
,
our worship service is highly participatory! Together, we sing, pray, read
Scripture, hear a message that applies to our daily lives, take communion, and
are charged to go and make disciples of all nations!
SECOND,
we do these things
because this is what the Church has always done! Our worship service is taken
directly from what Jesus said to  the 12 apostles:
"Do this in
remembrance of me."
Sunday School @9:30am
Fellowship with coffee @10:10 am
Worship @10:30 am.
Children are always welcome in the church and nursery is available.
Our Vision is God's
vision.
When Jesus taught his disciples how to pray, he said,
âThy Kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is
in heaven.â
Therefore, this is our vision statement at CTR. First and
foremost, it is Godâs own vision.
And, we at CTR only want what God has in mind for us. So, we continue to walk by faith as we obey God's Great Command, follow His
Great Commission and
worship in the Great Tradition.
Our Core values
Worship â
Discipleship â Fellowship â Mission â Evangelism â Stewardship â Prayer
Taken from our vision and mission
above, these core values drive every decision we make. They are our governing
principles by which we discuss and discern the ministry God has given us to do
at CTR.
