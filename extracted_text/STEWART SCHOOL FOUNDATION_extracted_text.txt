Buffalo Lake-Hector-Stewart School Foundation
"Where educating our future comes first!"
The BLHS School Foundation was organized in April of 2006 to provide additional Educational Resources for Educational Excellence within our BLHS Community.
Financial support of our school is challenging as state and federal funding is declining.  Population in rural BLHS is decreasing with fewer resources available for a quality education for our children.
You can help by investing in either the Project Fund or Endowment Fund with the BLHS School Foundation.
Endowment Funds are invested and never spent.  The earnings from the Endowment fund can be used.  Project Funds are used for immediate resources to maintain educational excellence.
You can invest in the foundation with an outright gift, legacy,  a memorial, or an honorarium. The investments that you make are tax deductible and can be made by check or by credit card. Or, you can mail your check to BLHS School Foundation, PO Box 522, Hector, MN 55342.  You will receive a tax receipt from the Southwest Initiative Foundation.  Through the Southwest Initiative Foundation, the BLHS Foundation has a non-profit status and an accounting source.
The Buffalo Lake-Hector-Stewart School students’ thank you for the resources provided to them by the Buffalo Lake-Hector-Stewart School Foundation supporters!
More information pertaining to the Southwest Initiative Foundation and the BLHS School Foundation can be found by going to the
