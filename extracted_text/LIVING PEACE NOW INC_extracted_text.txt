Donate
Are you enjoying being part of our community?  If you are able, please support us financially with a one time or monthly pledge.  A small monthly pledge is most welcome— it helps us budget and plan!
These contributions are voluntary and optional.
A portion of all your donations helps some one who can’t afford to pledge to enjoy our  programming.  As we are a charitable NGO (Non- Governmental Organization, non profit ,) 100 percent of our income is used to further our goal of building peacemaking  communities globally.  We will deeply appreciate your financial assistance.
Support the cause
How we serve
Each month the community focuses on a theme which has covered, just to name a couple, "Simplicity", "Diversity" and now "Love" . Guides lead programs that include meditations, music, spirituality, language courses, book readings and so much more.
Overall Goal
Through fun & powerful methods and regular participation, you'll learn to love yourself, heal yourself and advance yourself. Developing into a global community of peacemakers that are learning multiple languages to use our gifts to change the world, one person and community at a time.
