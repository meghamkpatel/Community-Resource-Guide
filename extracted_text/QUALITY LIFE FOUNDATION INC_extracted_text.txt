From Our Community Nationwide
As a county veteran service officer, the Quality Of Life Foundation provides expertise in all areas of the VA caregiver program, offering education for our team, and providing support for the veteran families that we serve.  The QoLF team provides personalized education, support and advocacy that cannot be found anywhere else.
Veteran Service Officer
“Andrea's testimony... brought me to tears to hear those words said out loud, THANK YOU. What it means to me is beyond words that I can express.”
Caregiver of a Wounded Veteran
To have QoLF take the lead and connect us to the PCAFC Administrator DIRECTLY so we could share our concerns, experiences, solutions and to feel “heard.”  Many positive results came out of those meetings which would have not happened without the advocacy and leadership of QoLF.
