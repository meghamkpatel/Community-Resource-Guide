About Pinnacle
Supporting Our Community
Supporting Our Community
Supporting our community is not just a corporate responsibility. It's a fundamental part of who we are.
Supporting quality of life initiatives helps build stronger communities that allow for more people to prosper. When that happens, everyone wins.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we started a program called Pinnacle Cares to show clients and associates our concern for their wellbeing. It has since expanded to include all the ways we have always cared for our communities.
That takes many shapes, from associates volunteering as financial literacy teachers to supporting loan programs for affordable housing and a lot more.
Serving the Community
Pinnacle associates contribute tens of thousands of volunteer hours to hundreds of causes every year. That includes our annual Make a Difference Day, where teams throughout the firm choose projects ranging from helping a client in a difficult situation to teaming up with a local nonprofit organization to meet a specific need.
As a company, we care about the causes that are near and dear to our team. Looking at the organizations our associates put their time and energy into helps us determine what efforts we should support as a company.
Giving to the Community
We are proud of our track record of financial support. We don’t write one big check to one organization. Instead, we back the many nonprofit causes that are most important to our associates. In all, 1 percent of our pre-tax profits go to support these organizations.
We contribute to organizations in these major categories:
Education
Health and human services
The arts
Economic development
Diversity, equity and inclusion
One aspect of economic development has become our top community priority: affordable housing. To further this cause, Pinnacle has:
Provided financing for hundreds of affordable housing units
Serviced Habitat for Humanity home loans at no cost to Habitat or the homeowners
Helped transform blighted neighborhoods by:
Investing directly in buying blighted lots and building new homes for first-time and low-income homeowners
Investing in organizations that enable those homeowners to get loans outside the traditional banking system
Given down payment assistance for hundreds of affordable single-family homes
Opened an Individual Development Account program to match down payment funds
Helped more than 100 families remain in their homes through grant funding, counseling services and assistance from the state
We have also supported programs at organizations like Pathway Lending, Affordable Housing Resources, Knoxville Area Urban League and United Housing in Memphis, just to name just a few.
Serving Nonprofits
Several of our financial advisors specialize in the financial needs of nonprofit organizations. Our services include everything from deposits and loans to advice on investment policy and giving programs.
It is an honor to support the communities that support us.
