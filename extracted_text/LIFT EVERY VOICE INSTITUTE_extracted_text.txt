about us
From The Providence Black Repertory Company, to the ArtsLiteracy Project at Brown University, to Habla in Merida, Mexico, Don and Kurt have been building deeply inclusive organizations together for over two decades.
DONALD KING
was the Founding Artistic Director of The Providence Black Repertory Company. His leadership, vision and award winning theatre, public programming and education transformed schools, communities and cultural landscapes throughout the City of Providence. He co-produced Providence Sound Session, a genre defying music festival and Parade, in partnership with the Department of Art, Culture + Tourism strategically managing community engagement and creative partnership opportunities between municipalities, businesses, law enforcement and neighborhoods. King’s vision to create forums where every voice is lifted is inspired by his firsthand experience in seeing people, places and perspectives transformed.
KURT WOOTTON
began his career as a public school teacher in Providence, Rhode Island. In his English classrooms he integrated the arts with literacy in order to “lift the voices” of all his students. This core idea has continued throughout his life as he’s built schools in different countries, consulted with school districts, and led ground-breaking education initiatives in the areas of culture, the arts, and literacy development.
Let’s get started.
The LEV Institute is available in-person or virtually in a one- to three-day format for businesses, educational institutions and cultural organizations worldwide.
