WHO WE ARE:
SpiritHouse is a multigenerational Black women- led cultural organizing tribe with a rich legacy of using art, culture and media to support the empowerment and transformation of communities most impacted by racism, poverty, gender inequity, criminalization and incarceration. Since 1999, we have worked from our home base in Durham, North Carolina, to uncover and uproot the
systemic barriers
that prevent our communities from gaining the resources, leverage and capacity necessary for long-term self-sufficiency.
We are Black, cash poor, disabled, queer, formerly incarcerated, grassroots organizers, artists, alchemists, strategists, healers and ritualists. We are multi-generational, valuing the genius of Black youth and the lived experience and wisdom of our elders. We prioritize the leadership of the people at the center of the issue who are most impacted by systemic racism and oppression.
We say tribe because our embodied, liberatory practices preserve customs and rituals necessary to sustain our everyday lives. We share these culturally rooted practices in all of our community and collaborative spaces. Our greatest assets come from our lived experiences. As Black people in America, we have inherited both ancestral trauma and freedom. It's in our DNA. We therefore prioritize our need and our ability to give and receive deep, transformative, collective healing, rooted in our customs, rituals, resilience, radical imagination and true historical analysis.
