Ujima acts as a voice for the African diaspora by engaging the Black Community at its core. Adhering to the principle of Collective Work and Responsibility, we work to heal our communities through the engagement of its people.
WHAT IS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE?
A pattern of abusive and coercive behaviors, including physical, sexual and psychological attacks, as well as economic coercion, that adults or adolescents use against their intimate partners. Domestic violence is not an isolated, individual event, but rather a pattern of multiple tactics and repeated events. Unlike stranger-to-stranger violence, domestic violence assaults are repeated against the same victim by the same perpetrator. (References: Anne L. Ganley, Ph.D. and Susan Schechter, M.S.W.)
WHAT IS SEXUAL VIOLENCE?
A sexual act committed against someone without their freely given consent. Acts of sexual violence include but are not limited to: sexual exploitation, sexual harassment, sexual assault, and rape. (References: National Institute of Justice and National Sexual Violence Resource Center)
WHAT IS COMMUNITY VIOLENCE?
Exposure to intentional acts of interpersonal violence committed in public areas by individuals who are not intimately related to the victim. Acts of community violence include but are not limited to riots, sniper attacks, gang wars, drive-by shootings, bullying, workplace assaults, terrorist attacks, torture, bombings, war, ethnic cleansing, and widespread sexual, physical, and emotional abuse. (References: US Dept. of Veterans Affairs and The National Child Traumatic Stress Network)
