About Us
NCNC is a center for Nepali communities to blend and foster relationships with other communities in North Carolina while maintaining Nepali culture and identity. Founding members of the NCNC realized that a formal organization was required to better serve new Nepali immigrants, students, and travelers to and from here as well as provide an opportunity to extend helping hand to Nepal and around the world.
NCNC’s programs and activities throughout the year demonstrate significant contributions to the social and economic well-being of our community here.
