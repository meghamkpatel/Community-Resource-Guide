Losing faith in the developers
Not that I had a ton to begin with, but locking threads is a bad idea. This will not end well for you in the long term. Allow people to discuss the game, and please interact for once. A simple "We've heard you and will take things into consideration" would go miles.
I know I'm probably going to get banned and this is going to be locked anyway, but that kind of just proves my point.

I'm pretty sure it was more about the fighting than the statements about the game. A lot of offtopic posts were being deleted near the end, and prior to that there didn't seem to be any mod activity. That would be partly my fault, which I apologize for, but it's hard to just ignore slander.

It shouldn't matter. Let people duke it out. There's no reason to stop discussion. Sure, it might get tedious, but that's on the readers to decide "yeah no, I'm out of this thread".
If Amazon can let the Empress Theresa bickering go on for literal years unimpeded until the 5000 comment limit was reached, then so can any moderator.

You're not wrong. They could have deleted the off-topic posts, banned the offenders, and re-opened the thread, but it's still common practice for mods to delete off-topic comments. They would be doing that with or without the current heated topics of discussion.

not really , saw you insulting people and people insulting you back , with only the other people getting banned and not you simply because you were simping for the developers. anyways idk why everyone is crying, unlocking the dlc wont be that hard :) , no way i will ever support a company that does dlc before the main game is even finished. they have not even fixed the ssr reflection issues around the edges of the screen when looking at water bodies and such

He only got banned after he tried to start a new thread on the same subject, insisting that he was being censored because he posted his 'credentials'. It was after the thread was locked.

They both locked my thread AND marked a provable lie about their funding as the "answer". On top of claiming otherwise in the news update.

Sentence ONE of the official Funcom press release here states that they are now funded and published by Funcom. The devs themselves marked a comment as answer that claims they aren't funded by them. I called Steam support over this, this is absolutely intentional deception at this point.

For what it's worth I still trust these devs. This is one of those games that I keep coming back to year after year after it has already given me extremely good value. At some point it should be OK to charge for DLC. And it's not like the base game is expensive.

The second the criticisms starting getting locked reviews started to tank. Almost like theres a correlation....

It isnt the Eleon devs. They work for whoever made the massive mistake of taking money from the devil of the gaming industry that caused the uproar and whoever it is that is locking threads. The devs themselves have no blame in this.
Dont blame the developers for the destruction of the companies community. Odds are, whoever made the choice to join Funcom had no clue what their history was and how hated they are by so many.

And trust me,  on the other side of the fence there is just as many people who love funcom and it's history.

See this stuff is what gets threads locked or deleted just saying man. And you can't support them anymore you bought the game already either buy the dlc or not you can't support it any other way. I don't get why you got announce why you won't buy dlc me I don't like the content, not into that infection stuff in games or horror games although with this games graphics not really horror per say lol. But calm down no cares why you won't buy it, and again unless you the kidn of guy who buys 6 copies of the same game for some reason for yourself you can't really support it anymore then you did minus the dlc purchase.

Funcom specialise in buying up games with potential making them turn a profit and then pumping out a ton of DLC Paradox style to cash in a huge profit they are competant and know what they are doing they did a pretty good job with conan exhiles however there is no such thing as a free lunch expect lots high priced dlc that add very little to the game being pumped out at lightning speed and if we are very lucky that wont destroy the good things in the game already but make no mistake Funcom dont help small dev teams they eat them

Conan didn't really have high priced DLC in fact most of it was cheap cosmetics but Siptah, and you can 100% live with out the season passes in fact I ahven't played most the "season" to even bother looking at them mins first one because I wanted play crap out the sorcer free update and went "men toss them a bone" as I had money for some sorcerr themed cosmetics.
You don't need any them at all in that game. Its like this game dlc unless I got a pal who wants to play a server that requires it I won't buy it not out protest or fake principle I just don't care. Its generic space infection content I hate space horror games so I don't need it at all I mean only thing promises outside of that stuff is melee weapons again its a space game were I use guns, and ships with bigger guns I don't feel I am missing one bit for passing on it lol

This is huge, thank you.
Incidentally, I tried looking up Eric Lucas, one of the founders, and the guy who gave a statement in the press release. Most of what I'm getting is that press release and articles linking to it, but I did find something I didn't know, which is that the game was originally a failed Kickstarter. Take that how you will.
I get that the moderators might be unhappy with argumentative threads or perceived anger and harsh criticism, but please don't lock things down. Most of us just genuinely want answers. I can't express how huge it would be if I could just sit down and talk with the people in charge and get honest answers. Even if I disagree with the responses, I would at least have respect for them being willing to talk. Much more than locking and banning.

Yeah, I can't knock Conan Exiles.  What you have there is one excellent game and DLC that I actually use, throw in a battle pass which is cheap enough and if you do the challenges it's free for life. Not only that, some of the gear you get from the battle pass is cool stuff, so I don't feel ripped off.
Let's face it they could have chose worse publishers to market for them.  And like I said, we don't know the circumstances, it might have been that or go bust.
Really the best thing we can do is wait and see how things go, to try to kill the game for no solid reason is none productive.
On the topic of locking threads, when people are doing nothing but discussing the pro's and con's it is also none productive to try to silence them.
