Scholarships
Scholarships
Classes and Camps — Youth
Partial scholarships are awarded on the basis of financial need, student interest and available funds. Applicants must complete and return a scholarship request and registration form at least two weeks prior to the first class. Candidates will be notified by email. Scholarships for DAC School and camps are generously provided by a grant from the Fox Family Foundation, with additional support provided by Timmins Summer Scholarship Endowment, Wind Point Foundation, Sheetz, and individual donors. Please call our office for more information at 919-560-2726.
Visual Arts — Youth + Adults
Partial scholarships are awarded on the basis of financial need, student interest and available funds. These scholarships are available thanks to the Arlene Hyman Visual Arts Scholarship Fund, established in 2014 following her passing. The fund is intended to help others — whether children or adults — discover or advance their love of the visual arts. Arlene Hyman, always a lover of the arts, was a member of the Pastel Societies of New Jersey and North Carolina and her work had been juried into numerous exhibitions. After relocating to Chapel Hill in 2011, Arlene continued her studies at the Durham Arts Council and elsewhere in the region. Please call our office for more information at 919-560-2726.
Music Lessons — Youth
The Durham Arts Council is pleased to be able to provide partial scholarships through the Andrew Goodridge Music Scholarship Fund for students based on financial need and the desire to pursue music education. Andrew Goodridge was a life-long lover of the arts; as an all-state trombonist in his Connecticut high school,a graduate of Northwestern University with a degree in English and Poetry, a published poet in North Carolina, and an amateur actor here in Durham. His love of children and his joy and exuberance in life and the creative process make DAC a natural place to carry on his legacy. The Fund, created in his memory to support the DAC School Scholarship program, is a gift from his parents, Jane and George, and his sisters, Ellen and Carolyn. Additional contributions to this fund are always welcome. Please call our office for more information at 560-2726.
