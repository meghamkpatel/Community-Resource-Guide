La Mesita Latino Mental Health Provider Network
In our years of experience providing mental health and substance use services to Latino immigrant families, one thing has become clear to us — we need others in order to keep it up! We need community!
That’s why we’re building a network to connect people providing services to the Latino community. We call the network “La Mesita” to keep in focus that the network is like coming around a table to talk, share, and learn together.

Institutions
Organizations that serve Spanish-speakers will meet more National CLAS Standards and “provide effective, equitable, understandable, and respectful quality care and services.” This aims to increase trust, reduce fear that mental health treatment will result in deportation/hurt immigration status, and address barriers to care to reduce underutilization of mental health services by Latine people.
CLOSE
Communities
Latine community members will experience increased awareness of mental health resources. This awareness will be the result of community education that normalizes the way stress and trauma affect us, decreases stigma related to mental illness and mental health services, and helps connect clients to appropriate resources. Success would mean that more Latine community members experience positive mental wellbeing, whether they are using effective self care skills, getting support from a promotor or peer support specialist, or getting access to a culturally responsive clinician or family navigator.

Implementation Science
Implementation science is the study of how evidence-based programs can be embedded to maximize successful outcomes (Kelly and Perkins, 2012).
CLOSE
Technical Assistance
Technical Assistance and Consultation is training, information sharing, and/or support in applying techniques to improve the capacity of a program, organization or system to achieve specific goals.
CLOSE
Service Providers
Providers will have greater self-knowledge and awareness of how their culture impacts their communication style and how it may generate biases. Providers will increase their ability to be culturally responsive and have an expanded awareness of their clients’ values, customs, and traditions in assessment and goal setting to help clients adaptively heal while coping with racism.
CLOSE
Clients
Clients will engage in culturally and linguistically responsive services to support their mental health, allowing them to achieve their goals. Culturally responsive services and services provided in a language the client speaks may result in fewer missed appointments, greater client retention, and increased success in treatment.

Katy Sims, MD
Katy Sims, MD
attended Davidson College for her undergraduate degree and is now a fourth year Psychiatry resident at UNC School of Medicine. Katy’s dedication to psychiatry comes out of her realization that whole-body health often has to start with sound behavioral health — you can’t work on someone’s diabetes if they’re too depressed to make lifestyle changes. She especially likes working with Spanish-speaking populations because of how much being able to deliver treatments in their native language means to these clients.
