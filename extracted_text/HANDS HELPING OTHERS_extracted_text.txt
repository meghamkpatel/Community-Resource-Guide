About
OUR MISSION
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR COMMUNITY
We are a Christian based charitable non-profit ministry that provides minor home repair and maintenance to the greater RDU area of North Carolina.  We serve the elderly, single families, the disabled, and others who either are not physically able or don’t have the knowledge to do minor home repairs and maintenance. The goal of the Hands Helping Others ministry is not to just supply the labor to do repairs and maintenance, but also to minister to the person.  Hands Helping Others is a volunteer based ministry using people with various repair and maintenance skills.
WHAT BE BELIEVE
We Believe
: God is the Creator and Ruler of the universe.  He has eternally existed in three personalities: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  These three are co-equal and are one God.
​
We Believe
: Jesus Christ is the Son of God.  He is co-equal with the Father.  Jesus lived a sinless human life and offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice for the sins of all people by dying on a cross.  He arose from the dead on the third day to demonstrate His power over sin and death.  He ascended to Heavens glory and will return again someday to earth to reign as King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.
​
We Believe
: The Holy Spirit is co-equal with the Father and the Son of God.  He is present in the world to make people aware of their need for Jesus Christ.  He also lives in every Christian from the moment of salvation.  He provides the Christian with power for living, understanding of spiritual truth, and guidance in doing what is right.  He gives every believer spiritual gifts when they are saved.  As Christians, we seek to live under His control daily.
​
We Believe
: The Bible is God’s Word to us.  Human authors, under the supernatural guidance of the Holy Spirit, wrote it.  It is the supreme source of truth for Christian beliefs and living.  Because God inspires it, it is the truth without any mixture of error.
​
We Believe
: People are made in the spiritual image of God, to be like Him in character.  People are the supreme object of God’s creation.  Although every person has tremendous potential for good, all of us are marred by an attitude of disobedience toward God called “sin”.  This attitude separates people from God and causes many problems in life.
​
We Believe
: Salvation is God’s free gift to us but we must accept it.  We can never make up for our sin by self- improvement or good works.  Only by trusting in Jesus Christ as God’s offer of forgiveness can anyone be saved from sin’s penalty.  When we turn from our self-ruled life and turn to Jesus in faith we are saved.  Eternal life begins the moment one receives Jesus Christ into their life by faith.
​
We Believe
: Because God gives us eternal life through Jesus Christ, the true believer is secure in that salvation for eternity.  If you have been genuinely saved, you cannot “lose” it.  Salvation is maintained by the grace and power of God, not by the self-effort of the Christian.  It is the grace and keeping power of God that gives us this security.
​
We Believe
: People were created to exist forever.  We will either exist eternally separated from God by sin, or eternally with God through forgiveness and salvation.  To be eternally separated from God is Hell.  To be eternally in union with Him is eternal life.  Heaven and Hell are real places of eternal existence.
​
We Believe
: God instituted marriage as one man with one woman

F.A.Q
HAPPY CUSTOMERS
As a divorced mother of two children, I have a lot to juggle. When my home flooded after just 30 days of living there, I was overwhelmed. I had not even totally unpacked. Contractors were estimating the work would cost upwards of $10,000 to repair.
I was told about Hands Helping Others, which was just about to launch. I met with Roger and his wonderful wife Rosemary. Roger told me that he felt like his organization could work with me if I paid for materials, which were about $500.
My children and I worked with Roger and Bob. And now, for the first time in over two years, I have walls again! I am so grateful for Hands Helping Others. They were a blessing.
