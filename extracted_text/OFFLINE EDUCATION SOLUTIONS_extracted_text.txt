Information.
Education.
Everywhere!
In much of the developing world, 
and many parts of the rural U.S., there is
no
access to educational opportunities:
no Internet
, sparsely stocked libraries, out of date books and journals, and no connection to the world of information most of us access with the click of a mouse.
Billions of people are starving for information; literally dying for a lack of knowledge. 
Information and education allows people to survive and thrive.
"Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to 
				change the world."
Nelson Mandela

		the right hands at the right time.
