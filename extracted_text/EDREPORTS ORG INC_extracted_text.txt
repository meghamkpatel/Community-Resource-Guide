How Reports Are Developed
About
EdReports
Our mission is to increase the capacity of teachers, administrators, and leaders to
                        seek,
                        identify, and demand the highest quality instructional materials. See how our reviews
                        can lead
                        to better materials for students.

                        materials.

                        educators,
                        district coaches, and state content leaders who understand the importance of
                        high-quality
                        materials.
The Review
Process
At the heart of EdReports is a commitment to a by educator, for educator
                        instructional
                        materials review process. See how educators are leading the way to support teachers
                        with the
                        tools and resources they need to support students.
Why We Care
At EdReports, we know materials matter for kids. Our mission is to increase the
                capacity of teachers, administrators, and leaders to seek, identify, and demand high-quality
                instructional materials to ensure students at all levels receive an excellent education.
1
Student Learning
Rigorous college and career-ready standards can improve and deepen student learning.
                      What is
                      taught matters.
2
High Expectations for All
Not all students have the same access to high-quality instructional materials and this
                      perpetuates the opportunity gap.
3
Equity
When teachers are provided with high-quality materials and aligned professional
                      learning, this
                      increases the opportunity for all students to learn and grow.

Why Materials Matter to Me: With Math Curriculum Expert Leah Dix, Ph.D.
EdReports reviewer Leah Dix, Ph.D., on her journey in education, what makes instructional materials high quality, and reviewing high school math curriculum.
“When you’re adopting instructional materials, it’s easy to think that
              receiving the
              textbooks you’ve chosen is the end of the process. But really it’s only the
              beginning. These
              tools from EdReports guide us in assessing the strengths and weaknesses of our academic programs
              so that
              we can offer teachers targeted, strategic supports and ensure the materials we have will help
              students
              thrive.“
