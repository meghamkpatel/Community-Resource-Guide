Introducing The Youth Mentoring Collaborative
Critical Perspectives on Mentoring
Critical mentoring disrupts saviorism models that exist in traditional mentoring programs and considers how race, class, gender, sexuality, and other identities impact how youth experience the world and mentoring relationships. “Critical mentoring
places youth at the center
of the process,
challenging norms
of adult and institutional authority and notions of saviorism to
create collaborative partnerships
with youth and communities that recognize there are multiple sources of expertise and knowledge.” (
Torie Wieston-Serdan
, 2017)

The Youth Mentoring Collaborative believes that every organization should have access to quality consulting services. More than 75% of our current partners are local grassroots movements that don’t have the capacity to work
on
their organizations – that’s where our work comes in! Your support makes our work possible.

Who We Are and What We Do
The Youth Mentoring Collaborative (YMC) is a capacity-building organization dedicated to increasing the number of Black and Brown youth in identity-affirming mentoring relationships while working to dismantle the systemic barriers that youth and their families face on a daily basis.
