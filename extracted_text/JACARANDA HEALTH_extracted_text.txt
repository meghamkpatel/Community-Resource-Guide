where we work
Our mission is to transform health outcomes for
all
mothers and babies.
We partner with governments and local implementing partners to support mothers and babies access quality care in different contexts and geographies. Our roots are in Kenya, improving quality of care and outcomes for mothers and babies in partnership with 22 county governments and the national Ministry of Health. More recently, our impact has caught the attention of other country partners, including Eswatini and Ghana, paving the way for future scale-up across Africa.

This website discusses pregnancy and motherhood. While we use the term “mother” to mirror the language of the community we are collaborating with, we also acknowledge that not all pregnant people identify as “mothers.” We would like to recognize that pregnancy and motherhood can be experienced by people of all genders.
