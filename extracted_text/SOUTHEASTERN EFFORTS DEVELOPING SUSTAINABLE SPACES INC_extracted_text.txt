Developing the capacity of young people to respect life, the earth and each other through growing, cooking and sharing food.
SEEDS Durham
MISSION
Founded in 1994, SEEDS is a two-acre urban garden and kitchen classroom in the heart of Durham. SEEDS develops the capacity of young people to respect life, the earth, and each other through growing, cooking, and sharing food.
Developing the capacity of young people includes responsibility, teamwork, leadership, environmental stewardship, equity, community, problem solving and experiential learning. Our whole-child educational programming incorporates growing, cooking and sharing food to help young people become resourceful and confident individuals with the capacity and commitment to be future leaders in their workplaces, their families, and their communities.
