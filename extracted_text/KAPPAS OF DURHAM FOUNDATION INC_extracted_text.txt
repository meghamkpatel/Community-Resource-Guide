Kappas of Durham Foundation
Kappas of Durham Foundation
​
The Kappas of Durham Foundation, Inc. was incorporated on November 29, 2000 in the state of North Carolina as a nonprofit entity to provide programs benefiting the youth in Durham County, North Carolina. Historically, the Foundation’s programs have been oriented toward African-American males.  As the need for strong and positive male mentoring increases among all demographics, the Foundation looks to expand its programs to a more diverse population.
​
OUR MISSION:
To provide leadership in community education, mentorship, educational philanthropy and social causes to the benefit of the Durham community at large.
​
OUR VISION:
To become the premier Greek letter organization related Foundation providing services in the Durham Community.
​
The Kappas of Durham Foundation, Inc. is a nonprofit charitable entity that was granted tax-exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service as a Section 501(c)(3) organization on May 31, 2001. The Foundation is an affiliate of the Durham (NC) Alumni Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc.
​
On December 17, 2009, the Foundation closed on a commercial property on Durham’s historic Fayetteville Street that became the Kappas of Durham Community Center. The Community Center serves as a meeting place, education center and a place where community organizations can gather and meet.
