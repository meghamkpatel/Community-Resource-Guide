About
Family & Consumer Sciences Program
NC State Extension’s mission is to improve the well-being of the family through programs that educate, influence public policy, and help families put research-based knowledge to work in their lives. NC State Extension is NC State University’s largest outreach program, with centers serving all 100 counties and the Easte
rn Band of the Cherokee Indians. NC State Extension’s Family and Consumer Sciences (FCS) Program is a community based educational program that strengthens and transforms families by providing education on the most important issues that affect them. The core of all NC State Extension county FCS
prog
rams is nutrition, health, food safety, food preservation, and local foods systems. Our FCS agents deliver evidence-based programming in nutrition, health, food safety, food preservation, and local foods. In addition to the core, the FCS programs at the state and local county level may also address important community issues related to housing, parenting, family resource
management, human development, and aging.
