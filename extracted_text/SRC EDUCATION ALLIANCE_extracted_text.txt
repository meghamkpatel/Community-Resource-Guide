Student Programs
Since 1982 SRC has supported over 10,000 students as part of its unique collaborative research model. Of the SRC-supported students, nearly 60% of those graduated have joined sponsoring organizations or university faculties, or have continued on to pursue a higher degree. These students provide a path for technology transfer and an invaluable source of relevantly educated technical talent for the industry.
Benefits for Members
Member companies benefit greatly from SRC-sponsored student programs, as these organizations gain valuable access to this pool of talented, experienced student researchers. Member company personnel can use the student directory to find students whose backgrounds meet their interests. Many sponsored events around the country also allow industry recruiters the opportunity to meet and interact with these students.
Benefits for Students
Funding to do cutting-edge research is at the top of the list of benefits for SRC students. Students may be fully or partially funded through the research contracts. Students may also apply for funding through the Graduate Fellowship Program or the Master's Scholarship Program. Interaction with SRC member company experts is next on the list of benefits identified by students. Resume distribution through the SRC website increases student opportunities for internships and full-time hire through direct industry contact. SRC sponsored events provide opportunities to network with a wide range of industry experts and other students and faculty who are funded by SRC.
