Who We Are
The Durham Kennel Club was established in 1928 and incorporated in 1931.   We are devoted to the betterment of all dogs. Our members are dog   owners from all walks of life, many of whom are full time dog breeders,   weekend dog exhibitors or just concerned and interested pet owners. DKC is a   member club of the American Kennel Club.
Community Services
Our club gets involved with all legislation involving dogs. Some of our   members and their dogs visit rest homes and similar facilities.
Pet Therapy Dogs Making a Difference
Looking for a Puppy
We offer   a Breeder Information Service to the community providing information on   buying a puppy, finding breeders, and other information on dogs.
