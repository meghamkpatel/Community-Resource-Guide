Opportunities Through DKG
Being a part of DKG offers you many benefits!
Don’t miss out on the great networking opportunities, discounts, and leadership opportunity at DKG.
Recognitions
Members are not only appreciated, but recognized for their achievements in this organization.
Doctoral recipients are recognized at the international conventions biennially.
One member is selected by her peers for the International Achievement Award annually.
The Educators Book Award Committee awards $2,500 annually to one female author or joint authors whose book influences educational direction.
Advocacy
As a member of DKG you are automatically a member of a Forum based on your geographical area.  Each Forum has projects, professional reports and, when appropriate, information about proposed legislation with ramifications for educators, women and children’s welfare. DKG has a long relationship with UNICEF and the Committee Teaching About the UN.
The Society is a philanthropic force on the international scene giving millions of dollars each year in scholarships, grants, and project support. As a member you are a part of that philanthropy. You impact education worldwide!
Publishing
Not only do members receive publications as a part of their membership benefits, but they also are encouraged to submit articles to both.  The Delta Kappa Gamma
Bulletin Journal
is published 3 times a year and
Bulletin Collegial Exchange Magazine
is published 2 times a year. Members can also write articles for the
DKG NEWS
and submit artwork (photographs, videos, paintings, etc...) to the Fine Arts Gallery twice a year, once in the fall and once in the spring.
Discounts
Membership in DKG offers a variety of discounts exclusively for our members. There are discounts in insurances for you and your pets, on hearing aids, rental car expenses, and waived fees at Capella University just to name a few.  Additionally, members can shop through Amazon Smile, and Go Ahead Tours.
Travel & Networking
DKG members can experience other cultures by applying for and being selected as an international speaker.  Travel costs are paid for by the International Speaker Fund (ISF) and rooming costs are paid for by the host state organization.
Attending an international convention or conference and/or state organization convention affords members with the opportunity to connect with other members both locally and internationally and form life-long bonds as well as the possibility to not only view, but present workshops.
Leadership
Every DKG member is considered a leader – a woman who wants to make a difference. How you choose to lead is up to you but DKG offers support for that leadership in many ways:
through chapter and state organization opportunities;
international executive education seminars;
professional learning experiences during international conferences and conventions (continuing education units are offered at some of these events and at many state organization meetings.)
through sharing of ideas in the DKG Communities and in the Discovery Learning Centre
Financial Assistance
As a DKG member, you will find opportunities for scholarships at all levels: international, state organization, and possibly even your chapter. You can also benefit from various DKGIEF grants and should a natural disaster destroy your personal property, the DKG Emergency Fund offers financial assistance in the form of a check for $500.
