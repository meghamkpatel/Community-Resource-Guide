Mission Statement
The Herpetologists’ League, established in 1946, is an international organization of people devoted to studying herpetology — the biology of amphibians and reptiles. The Herpetologists’ League exists to promote scientific study and conservation of amphibians and reptiles. The primary goals of the League are to support the acquisition of knowledge about these organisms and to transmit that knowledge through publications, conferences, and symposia. Activities sponsored by the League are designed to engage and encourage young scientists to join in the League’s mission. The products of the League contribute to the global effort to understand and conserve biological diversity on Earth.
Diversity Statement
The Herpetologists’ League is committed to ensuring that all individuals feel welcome and included in herpetological research, mentoring, and teaching. We believe that unique and diverse perspectives and experiences strengthen our organization as a whole and, as such, this diversity and uniqueness should be fostered and nurtured. We are committed to promoting a diverse and inclusive environment that will foster a strong collaborative organization and which enables all established and aspiring herpetologists to feel respected, supported, and valued. HL is dedicated to inclusion and equity of all, regardless of race, color, religion, national origin, indigenous status, ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, disability, veteran status, genetic information, or members of any and all underrepresented groups.
