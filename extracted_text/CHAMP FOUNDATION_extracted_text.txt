Mission
The Champ Foundation supports research toward better treatment and a cure for single
            large-scale mitochondrial deletion syndromes (SLSMDS), like Pearson syndrome.
What is Pearson Syndrome?
Pearson Syndrome (PS) is a multi-system disease caused by a deletion in
						mitochondrial DNA. The hallmark features are sideroblastic anemia and
						pancreatic insufficiency. PS is often fatal in infancy. In addition to
						the hematological and pancreatic symptoms, PS can impair the heart,
						kidneys, eyes, ears and brain. Survivors develop Kearns-Sayre Syndrome.
Since its discovery in 1979 by Howard Pearson, there have only been
						around 100 cases reported in the medical literature.  PS is probably
						under-diagnosed, since few doctors are aware of the diseaseâ€™s existence,
						much less its symptoms.
The Champ Foundation was founded in 2015 in honor of William Reynolds, who was diagnosed
            with Pearson Syndrome when he was two months old. William was severely anemic and
            neutropenic for his first year, requiring many red blood transfusions. After a period of
            relatively stable health, William developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and required
            a bone marrow transplant when he was four. William was not the first child with Pearson
            Syndrome to receive a secondary diagnosis of MDS. More research and a better
            understanding of this disease is still needed. The Champ Foundation is committed to
            supporting this research.
