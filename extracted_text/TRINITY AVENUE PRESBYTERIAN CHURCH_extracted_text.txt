Our Church Family
We are a family of faith in Durham, North Carolina, seeking to glorify and enjoy God together.
Trinity Avenue Presbyterian Church is a community that welcomes all those who seek God and the message of love which Jesus Christ brings.
The hope and faith which we encourage in one another are gifts of God and part of God’s wonderful promise to be Emmanuel, God with us. As God has accepted us in Christ, so we seek to accept one another: in certainty and doubt, in weakness and in strength, with sincerity and humor.
