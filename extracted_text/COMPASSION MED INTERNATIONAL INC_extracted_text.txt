Your donation
provides both vital routine care and emergency care
— you could even save a child’s life.
Quality medical care is out of reach for many children in the world today.
Children living in poverty are especially vulnerable to disease and sickness. Your gift provides a child in poverty access to medical care that would otherwise be nearly impossible to obtain, including emergency care that can literally save their life. Give today and change a life forever.
19,000
Children Under 5
die every day from preventable ailments.
58%
Of Childhood Deaths
are caused by infectious diseases.
165M
Children Face Malnutrition
resulting in stunted growth and development.
Your donation provides a child with access to otherwise unaffordable medical care and resources!
Quality Treatments
A child can receive needed casts, wheelchairs, prosthetic limbs, cancer treatments, hearing and eye care, and dental care.

Every Day, Donors Like You Help Children like Steven
Eleven-year-old Steven was brutally attacked by teenage boys near his home. He was captured, bound, covered in gasoline and set on fire. He ran to a nearby river and was able to put out the fire. But none of the hospitals in his home country of Ecuador were equipped to deal with the severity of his burns, which covered more than 65% of his body.
Because of generous supports like you, the local Compassion center was able to send Steven to a hospital in the United States where a burn unit is providing him with the care he needs.
His family is praising God for his ongoing recovery! They are so thankful for the prayers and financial support they’ve received from supporters like you. More children like Steven are facing dangerous medical situations — you can step in to provide care.
