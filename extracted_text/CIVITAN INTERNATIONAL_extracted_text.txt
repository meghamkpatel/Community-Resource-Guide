A GLOBAL IMPACT
Civitan International is a global organization impacting lives at the grass roots level through local service clubs. Members of Civitan share a Servant’s Heart and a desire to create positive change for people with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.
A CENTURY OF SERVICE
Founded in Birmingham, Alabama in 1917, Civitan expanded rapidly into a global force for change. The message of good citizenship rooted in compassion, service, and respect for people in need is just as important today as it was on our first day more than a century ago.
A FOCUS ON RESEARCH
The Civitan International Research Center is the flagship program of Civitan International. Deeply rooted in the core mission of Civitan—serving people with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities—the CIRC conducts cutting edge research in brain-related issues such as autism, rett syndrome, down syndrome and many others. Civitan International is the only service organization dedicated to these issues which affect one in six people worldwide.
