1902 West Main Street, Durham
Saint Joseph’s Episcopal Church is located on Main Street between Ninth and Iredell Streets in Durham, NC, across from Duke University’s East Campus. Our community life is rooted in the sacraments, daily prayer, study of the Scriptures, and fellowship with members, friends and neighbors inside and outside our walls. Following the example of our patron Saint Joseph, we make our church a place of warm hospitality grounded in God’s love, and we take that love out into the world.
