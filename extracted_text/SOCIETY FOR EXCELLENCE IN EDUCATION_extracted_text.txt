Committed to Leading the Way in Medical and Biomedical Education
The mission of the Institute for Excellence in Education (IEE) is to promote, value and advance the educational mission of the School of Medicine while enhancing the school's leadership role in medical and biomedical education. To guide this mission, IEE has identified four guiding principles or "pillars" into which all of our decisions, work and programs are aligned.
For the 2023-2024 academic year, the IEE is highlighting the theme of
“Successful Education: Thriving Learners, Flourishing Educators.”

Educator Domains, Competencies and Metrics
The
Educator Domains, Competencies and Metrics
were developed by a diverse committee of Hopkins educator faculty, leaders and educators. We hope these tools will be useful to faculty as they plan their educational careers; mentors, coaches and advisors as they help guide faculty; leadership as they plan and build programs; and those evaluating educators to give recognition for the work done.
It is also our hope that the
Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Foundational Principles for Teaching and Education
will be inspiring to Johns Hopkins leaders, educators and learners.
