OUR BACKSTORY
Straight Talk Support Group was started by Ms. Bessie Elmore in March of 2013 as a support group for those who sought answers and resources for the loved ones they were supporting during incarceration.  Her experience in reentry came as mother of a justice involved son who spent twenty-five years under confinement in North Carolina’s Department of Corrections.
​The home was originally built in 1915 for William Umstead and sold to E.T. Rollins, owner of the Durham Herald.  In the 70s and 80s, Transition of Youth, Inc., also known as The Troy House, operated as a residential and personal care service and correctional center for youth and up until 2017, provided services for Federal Bureau of Prisons.
The Troy House, STSG Transitional House’s predecessor at 1101 North Mangum Street, is now the home of STSG and continues to provide temporary housing assistance to justice involved individuals released from North Carolina’s Department of Public Safety.  Since 2018, STSG Transitional House and Straight Talk Support Group has provided temporary housing and program assistance for justice-involved men.
OUR MISSION
STSG's mission is to be a voice in the community of Justice Involved Individuals and their families and friends that informs, supports, and empowers.
OUR VISION
Our vision is serving to see greatness in Justice Involved Individuals by providing them with 360-degree care and offering support to their family members with the help of the community and our charitable partners.
