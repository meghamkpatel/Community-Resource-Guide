Cumberland Culinary Center Passes Major Milestone
February 12, 2019
Cumberland University announced today that the Cumberland Culinary Center passed a major milestone during the month of January when it packaged its one millionth unit of product.
The Cumberland Culinary Center, a 2,400 square-foot facility, houses a commercial kitchen and storage space that is intended to aid entrepreneurs and farmers in producing, promoting and packaging their products. The center’s focus is on locally grown and produced goods in conjunction with the Pick Tennessee Products initiative.
The Cumberland Culinary Center began operations in June 2010 after receiving grant monies from the United States Department of Agriculture and the Tennessee Agriculture Enhancement Program. It has also received support from the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, Performance Food Service, Wilson County School System, Lochinvar Corporation, Lowe’s, Rock Island Nursery and many others.
Southern City Flavors and the Nashville Jam Company are the two customers currently preparing and packaging the highest volume of product through the center. It was a Southern City Flavor product that had the distinction of producing the one millionth unit. The list of other current customers includes: Cajun Seafood, LLC, Corner Market, Crafted Concoctions, Culinary CreaShunz, Kelley’s Berry Farm, Lavish Hill Farms, Muddy Pond Sorghum, Ousley Ouch, Painturos, Riverfront Plantation, Ron Reed’s Signature Barbeque Sauce Company, Smokey’s Gourmet Products, Tennessee Gourmet, T&L Honey and the Smiling Itinerant.
Since it began operations, the Culinary Center kitchen has been managed by Sue Sykes and Gary Dummer.
“We have enjoyed helping small entrepreneurs over the years to help them bring their product dreams to market,” said Sykes. “We have been truly blessed with working with people that have great product ideas and most importantly the passion to become successful.”
Membership with the Cumberland Culinary Center is open to Tennessee-based farmers, specialty food producers and suppliers. For more information on membership and services available through the center go to www.cumberland.edu/culinary-center/or call Sue Sykes at 615-453-1617.
