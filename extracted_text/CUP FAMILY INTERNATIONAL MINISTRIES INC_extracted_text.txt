Why didn’t the Ministry arrest the Death Eaters at the World Cup?
Discussion
This group of wizards were committing heinous crimes against this family of 4 Muggles. They were held 60 feet high, the mother was turned upside down to expose her underwear (this is a sex crime), and one of the children was spun around so fast, he lost consciousness and his head was flopping as he spun (child abuse). How can the might of the Ministry, which I assume includes Aurors and Law enforcement for security at the World Cup, be unable to either rescue the Roberts family or arrest any Death Eater? I understand that there was a fear of dropping the people, but Arresto Momentum is a 5th year spell, not terribly complicated. And there was a crowd that was isolating the Death Eaters from the ministry, but if they’re obstructing justice, they’re complicit and should be arrested as well. I am just appalled that these crimes were allowed to occur to innocent people and the entire ministry of magic was so incompetent. It’s no wonder Voldemort was so successful, just a few Death Eaters were able to overcome elevated Ministry security at a sporting event
