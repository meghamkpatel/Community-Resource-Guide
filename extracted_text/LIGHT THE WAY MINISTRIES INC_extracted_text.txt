A CHANGE OF HEART LED TO THE CREATION OF
LIGHT THE WAY
After struggling with drug and alcohol addictions, founder and CEO John Wilson found salvation in Missouri in 2017.
Over the last 18 years, John has worked in the music industry, but only for the previous 7 years in Christian music. The impact that Christian music has on people's lives was made apparent to John while he promoted a small Christian concert as a joke. Upon receiving Christ as his Lord and Savior, he was immediately delivered from his addictions.
After seven years of producing some of the biggest Christian Music Festivals, John now feels the call to be more focused on the hearts of the hurting and the broken through a Revival ministry.
We are introducing the Light the Way Ministry Revival Tour, a series of gatherings throughout the country. We hope to come to a location near you! We expect God to move through many lives with Healings, Deliverances, On-the-Spot Baptisms, Salvations, and Breakthroughs.
WANT TO SEE
REVIVAL IN YOUR TOWN?
One person cannot do this by themselves, but together we can reap a remarkable harvest! In order to reach innumerable numbers of lives through Christ, we are seeking
churches, ministries, and groups of believers to join us. We need YOU!
We will provide the entire setup for each revival. Our basic setup includes a baptism tank, possibly a tent (unless a spacious enough auditorium is provided), a stage/platform, production, collective teams of worship leaders, and special guest speakers.
