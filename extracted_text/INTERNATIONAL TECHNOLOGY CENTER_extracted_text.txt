International Technology Center
The
International Technology Center
(ITC) is a
501(c)(3) 
                          non-profit
research corporation established 
                          to foster economic development through innovation in 
                          advanced microfabrication technologies. Through grants 
                          from federal government agencies and industrial sponsors, 
                          ITC seeks to pursue applied research programs in cooperation 
                          with local, state, national and international partners. 
                          By relying on a network of partners, ITC has access 
                          to a broad range of materials and process technologies 
                          that enable the microfabrication of a range of novel 
                          devices, as well as computational modeling from basic 
                          materials science to advanced integrated circuits.
