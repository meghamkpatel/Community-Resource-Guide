More than $153,000 in scholarships was awarded to Central Lakes College students.
The CLC Foundation recently announced the scholarship recipients for fall semester this month.
“As the cost of a college education continues to increase, CLC Foundation scholarships play and even greater role in the lives of CLC students as they pursue their dreams of a career,” said Pam Thomsen, executive director of the CLC Foundation. “We thank our donors for the crucial assistance they provide in scholarships to more and more college students.”
Each student application was read, reviewed and rated at least three times. Fifty-one percent of students who submitted an application received a scholarship, with the average scholarship award being $575.
“By receiving this scholarship, I am able to concentrate on what is important to me and that is my education. Thanks to (the) kind and generous financial support I will be one step closer to earning my teaching degree, which has been a passion of mine,” said CLC student Leilani Stirewalt, recipient of the E. Terry Skone Scholarship Fund.
CLC student Jennifer Gulseth, Maxwell Douglas Adamek Best Scholarship recipient, added, “By awarding me this scholarship, I am able to concentrate on what is important for me, education. (The) financial generosity has allowed me to be one step closer to my goal and has inspired me to help others by giving back to the community.”
Evan Reese, Crow Wing Power and Light Scholarship recipient, said “When I graduate, I hope that I can use what I have learned at CLC to strive further into my education and make a difference in many people’s lives.”
The Spring 2016 scholarship application will open Sept. 1.
