UCAN’s Commitment to Fresh Food Access
Urban Community AgriNomics (UCAN) is a 501(c)3 nonprofit founded April 29th, 2016 by sisters, Delphine Godley Sellars and Lucille Godley Patterson. This organization reflects their desire to engage the community of Northern Durham with skills based in agriculture and providing a place for those within the community to have access to fresh fruits and vegetables. UCAN has donated over 60,000lbs of fresh vegetables and fruits, through local harvesting and gleaning events sponsored by the Society of St. Andrews. UCAN provides opportunities for a diverse group of board members and volunteers.
A partnership with Triangle Land Conservancy (TLC) led to a User License Agreement, resulting in the creation and development of the Catawba Trail Farm.

BLACK EARTH MATTERS
This poster was created for Urban Community AgriNomics (UCAN) by Dr. McAdoo and his graduate students. Isn’t it wonderful?
We’d love for you to take a moment and read through this ‘Black Earth Matters: Soil Justice and Black Farms in North Carolina’ poster, and dive deep into the history of The Catawba Trail Farm, soil and geology information, and the issue of food insecurity.

“What you guys weren't aware of this morning when I asked for the additional box for the lady who had breast cancer surgery was she telephoned me yesterday and asked me to bring her some fruit. She gave me her list. When I saw you guys included muscadines and apples I was overcome with emotions. I said the Holy Spirit "ain't" no joke! Those two among some others were on her list. Here I am helping someone and the Holy Spirit helped me to help her. How powerfully cool is that?
Now let me tell you what I prepared. With the zucchini I made zucchini pie with a phyllo crust and zucchini soup. The kale will be prepared the African way. All good!!!!!
Words will never convey my gratitude for what you all do for the community.
Much love and continued success.......”

My wife and I have been looking to get into gardening. At first, we were going to take a class, but figured why not make sure it's something we want to do before investing hundreds of dollars. My Wife found Catawba Trail Farm from their Instagram page. We saw they had a volunteer program and thought it would be cool to try it out since we live close by.  WOW!   All I can say is, this place was so much fun, we were surprised at how open everybody was! I was expecting to be put to work and maybe learn a few things in the process. We got much more than we expected!  There were a few other volunteers but not many, Duke university had some students there and they were teaching a class, I got to listen in!  We got to really learn a lot. The group here really does operate like a big family farm, the history of this farm is really touching. It used to be a slave plantation; my ancestors came from the south so it was moving to see all races together for the good of the land. I have been looking for this kind of a feeling in North Carolina since I moved here from California. I have visited farms back in California but the history of these farms makes this place feel more like Holy land as opposed to just a farm!  When you come here you will see, it is a life changing experience. I learned how to work with the compost, which is what they use on their garden beds. I will be taking off work every weekend to come down and volunteer. It is therapeutic and I could not imagine a better place to learn the skills of agriculture, at the Catawba farms. Mrs. Lucille was super; she even invited my 5 year old daughter to come back so they can teach her how to grow vegetables too! Last but not least they have everything there, soil, beds, tools and they are super generous and willing to teach you everything they know. What more can you ask for! The Soul of this place is so Amazing, I feel like I am making my ancestors proud every time I come to the Catawba Trail Farm, this beautiful piece of land! Please don’t hesitate to visit this place if you are in North Carolina. You must come down and see this beautiful farm!”
