Founded in Durham, North Carolina in 2020, The Forgiven Sons, Inc. is a Christian organization within the Raleigh-Durham area; helping teach, fortify, and strengthen athletes in middle school, high school, and college by utilizing Christian based principles, emotional regulation tactics, self-esteem enhancement techniques, and athletic development. Our mission as an organization is to focus on decreasing: depression, suicide, unemployment, and dropout rate(s) amongst student-athletes through spiritual enlightenment, acts of altruism, and sports-related trainings.
