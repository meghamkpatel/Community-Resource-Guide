Keys are on a key holder on the wall of the house. One key is labeled “HOUSE KEYS ONLY.”
00:17-00:19
A note is seen on the bathroom mirror. It says, "Cancel Dr appointment Mon." The word “Cancel” has been crossed out, and in different handwriting below is written, "Keep it, Hun. I'll drive you."

The woman, as a young child, is seen in old home movie-style footage dancing on the beach in a red-skirted bathing suit.

A close-up of a journal is shown with the words, "I miss them."
00:25-00:26
A phone is seen ringing. Next to the phone is an envelope that's being used as a notepad. It says, "Try Anjali Again." Under that, three different dates are written and have been crossed out.
00:27
As the phone still rings, a family picture is sitting on a side table in the home.
00:28-00:30
The answering machine is heard: "At the tone, please record your message." A woman is seen in the background getting ready for the day. In the foreground, a note is taped to a clock that says, "You haven't upset anyone."

The answering machine beeps, and old home movie footage of the pregnant woman shown earlier is playing. She is laughing in a garden.

00:41
Husband and wife embrace, and the husband asks, "Honey, are you alright?"
00:42-00:50
A clock begins ticking, and as it continues, moments of the woman's life are shown. There are various scenes of her life as she's growing up, and we see her looking at her journal with the words "You are still you” written.
00:51-00:53
The woman sits on her bed, looking at her journal. The text on the screen reads, "People with Alzheimer's take notes to remember."
00:54-00:56
The woman, as a young child, is again seen dancing on the beach in a red-skirted bathing suit. The text on the screen reads: "30 years of research hasn't forgotten them."
00:57-00:60
As the young child continues dancing on the beach, the text on the screen fades, and the Lilly logo appears: "Lilly, A medicine company."
