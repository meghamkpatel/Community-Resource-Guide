What We Do
Institute Capital, the Institute’s lending arm, is a certified Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) that provides strategic lending and investment for community economic developers and businesses that create jobs, promote economic growth, and facilitate the development of affordable housing and community revitalization, particularly in low-resource areas.
