About Us
Mallarmé Music (formerly
Mallarmé
Chamber Players) has been bringing world-class chamber music to central North Carolina since 1984.
Based in Durham, NC we strive to bring together great music with other art forms, as well as expand the definition of chamber music.
Our name is taken from the 19th century poet, Stéphane Mallarmé, who was known for his
salons –
gatherings of intellectuals at his house in Paris for discussions of poetry, art and philosophy.
