About Beta Phi Mu
Beta Phi Mu recognizes the scholastic achievement and leadership potential of members LIS and others in related fields, and fosters the values of scholarship, leadership, and service in its members.
Eligibility for membership in Beta Phi Mu is by invitation of the faculty from institutions where the American Library Association, or other recognized accrediting agency approved by the Beta Phi Mu Executive Board, has accredited or recognized a professional degree program.
Beta Phi Mu is a
certified member
of the
Association of College Honor Societies.
​Our name comes from the initials of the Greek words
Bibliothekarios philax mathesis
, meaning “librarians are the guardians of knowledge.” The insignia of Beta Phi Mu is the dolphin and anchor, mark of the Venetian printer Aldus Manutius. ​ The motto,
Aliis inserviendo consumor
, meaning “Consumed in the service of others” was selected by the founders based on the concept of the dedication of librarians and other information professionals to the service of others.
