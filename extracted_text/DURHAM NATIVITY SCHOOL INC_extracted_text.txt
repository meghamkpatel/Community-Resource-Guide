Dare to Dream Big! Never Give Up! Strive to Excel!
Durham Nativity School is dedicated to providing a nurturing and enriching learning environment along with a comprehensive twelve-year support system tailored for middle school boys. Our aim is to empower students who possess the determination to excel academically but may lack the means for a high-quality independent school education. By integrating comprehensive academics and growth, we nurture the inherent potential of every child, placing significant emphasis on the value of knowledge, ethical principles, academic competence, self-control, and the cultivation of character. Achieved through the implementation of smaller class sizes, extended school hours, and an enriched academic calendar, our approach is dedicated to instilling a sense of selflessness, shaping the next generation of exemplary individuals, and fostering pioneers within our community.

Academics
It was the vision of our founder, Dr. Joseph Moylan that Durham Nativity School would provide a learning environment for eligible middle school boys in grades fifth through eighth.  Dr. Moylan envisioned a program in Durham to support students in their personal, social, moral, and intellectual development, as well as position them to be successful in college-preparatory high schools and beyond.
