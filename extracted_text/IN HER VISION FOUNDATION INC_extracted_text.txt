More than 700 million people worldwide are living in extreme poverty — most of them women and children.
With an income of less than $2.15 per day, they are
deprived of basic human needs like access to  clean water, nutritious food, healthcare, education, and spiritual nurture.
We believe that, together, we can change this.
