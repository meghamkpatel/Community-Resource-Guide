Welcome
Welcome to the 75th year of the University Woman’s Club! We are looking forward to a wonderful year of friendship, social activities, intellectual stimulation, and continued support for our scholarship fund.
We welcome all women in the area to join our club. I have been a member for over 20 years! When I was new to the area, I found it a great way to learn about the area and make new friends. We have many interest groups, activities, and programs that appeal to a variety of interests: cooking groups, book clubs, bridge, mahjong, museum trips, and countless exciting programs.
I really hope you will decide to become a UWC member. The membership form is available on this website under the
Membership tab
. Dues for 2023-2024 are $50.
The Board and I look forward to seeing you soon, both our existing members and those who are new to the UWC!
