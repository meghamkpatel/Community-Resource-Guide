Queen's Feast
RETURN OF THE MONARCH
An interactive Tudor Feast of Intrigue
Butler Barn - 22242 SW Scholls Ferry Rd -
​
map
​
The Queen’s Feast is an interactive dining experience where guests can feel a part of a traditional Tudor feast with just a little dash of intrigue for the invited guests... are you a loyalist or a rebel?
​
Join us as we celebrate the amazing Queen Elizabeth I, preparing for her speech to the troops in Tilbury who are preparing to defend England from the Spanish Armada. Throughout the dinner, courses are presented theatrically, accompanied by a traditional madrigal song performed by a quartet of singers. Special guests like William Shakespeare and the Chamberlain's Men will perform his works in progress, a charming Renaissance band will strum away beautiful music of the time, and other exciting acts will take place for the pleasure of the court. But little do they know a sinister plot to unthrone the Queen is at hand. Will you help in the unseating or stand guard to protect the Crown?

Let's Exchange the Experience
Experience Theatre Project is an innovative, immersive theater company based in beautiful Beaverton, Oregon. We strive to create imaginative stories told in an innovative style. Our goal is to give you an experience, and a story that takes place all around you, not unlike a haunted house or a Disney experience.
​
Our experiences take place in unconventional  spaces, such as a storefront, lodge, or winery.  We pride ourselves in bringing together small groups of audiences to experience our shows, from Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap to original adaptations of Oscar Wilde and F. Scott Fitzgerald.
