LIVE
INSIDE
THE LOVE OF GOD
The first disciples of Jesus were known for their love of God, each other, and their neighbors. Even the Roman government was amazed at how the small groups of Christians in neighborhood house churches served and fed the poor and took care of the children in each community.
Live Inside

LIVE
UNDER
THE LORDSHIP OF JESUS
It was obvious from an early creedal statement that Jesus Christ was Lord and not the Roman Caesar. Early disciples confessed that Jesus was Lord and lived a resurrected “style-of-life” that was counter-cultural to the local governments.
Live Under
»
LIVE BY THE
LEADING
OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
The gospel promise (“good news”) was more than just forgiveness of sins. It was the promised gift of the Holy Spirit to all Christians whether Jew or Greek, slave or free, male or female. “Living by the Spirit” produced love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.
