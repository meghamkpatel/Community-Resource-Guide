Any promotion I have ever received at work has been due to my involvement in JCI. Hands-on experience in project management, volunteer coordination, and other leadership skills has proven to be essential in all of my career moves. JCI bridges the gap between what a young person learns in school and what they need to know to become a successful and active citizen. 10/10 recommend to every young person I see.
Nikki Schaul
The opportunity to meet like-minded people, get involved in the community, and participate in the calendar of chapter projects was exciting. The skills in project management and leadership I was learning began to be noticed by my work colleagues and supervisors. I found myself being offered new roles at work. For me, there is a direct correlation between my growth in JCI USA and growth at work. I also became fascinated with how JCI worked around the world and it took me to places like Canada, India, Estonia, Russia, Finland, Aruba, and Curacao for official JCI conferences and tours. Whether your ambition is big or small, JCI USA can provide opportunities to go after the dreams you didn’t even know you had.

Soon after joining the Jaycees my chapter president encouraged me to attend North American Academy (NAA). NAA was full of diverse instructors and participants who valued the impacts that JCI makes. During the weekend all of the participants were thoroughly challenged individually and in group settings. I felt like NAA taught me how to overcome challenges that may face me in my professional, social, and personal life. This experience through JCI USA far exceeded any expectations that I had prior. As a member of JCI USA, both my state and local chapters helped provide funds for me to attend NAA.
