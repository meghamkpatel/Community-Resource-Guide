Our Scholars
Spring 2016 marked the launch of our scholarship application and our inaugural class of scholars. Each year, we work with two new Pupusa scholars to provide scholarships, nurture their passions, and empower them through graduation.
Jatzyri P.
University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, NC
2019 Scholar Jatzyri is a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where she hopes to major in Neuroscience. Born in Mexico City, Jatzyri has lived in North Carolina since she was 2 years old, and considers it her home. The college application process is an exciting time for many students all over the world. Yet for Jatzyri, it was a time filled with uncertainty and worry. Applying to colleges whilst being a first-generation high school graduate, DACAmented student, and coming from a low-income household was one of the hardest experiences that she has had to endure. However, thanks to generous donors, scholarships such as Pupusas for Education, and years of hard work, Jatyzri is now very excited to pursue her dreams and continue living as an example of Latinx excellence. Go Heels!
Jesus P.
Guilford College in Greensboro, NC
2020 Scholar Jesus Peralta Porras immigrated to the United States back in 2003 from Puebla, Mexico. He says that even though he wasn’t born in the US he grew up here and doesn’t remember anything about Mexico. The only way he was able to connect with his family’s culture was through the traditions and customs his family shared with him such as their native language, food, and holidays. Growing up Jesus shares that his environment pushed him into hiding who he was because of a ‘Machista’ mindset. Being Mexican he says in a predominantly white school put a label on his back to his peers and teachers that said “he isn’t actually serious about school” and he says he had to work twice as hard in his higher-level classes to be seen as equal to his white counterparts. Through various nonprofit organizations such as the Minority Student Achievement Network, Students Against Violence Everywhere Jesus says he was able to hear about the issues minorities face and learned about the value of youth advocacy and activism. In the future, Jesus hopes to have received his degree in Community and Justice and work in a school system to help motivate and inspire children to be their authentic selves and fight for minorities’ rights. Most importantly he is super honored to work with an organization that serves authentic Salvadorian food with a side of JUSTICE!
Sharon U.
Christian Brothers University in Memphis, TN
2021 schoalr Sharon G. Urrutia-Moreira was born in Escuintla, Guatemala and came to North Carolina when she was only two years old. She stated that she faces many obstacles as she grew and had trouble finding her identity due to the fact that she spoke little to no spanish. As she continued to grow, she began to learn more about her beautiful culture and began to learn to write, read and speak in spanish. Not only that, she promised her family that she would go to college and pursue the "american dream." She stated that it was diffifuclt, she went through many sleepless nights and even had more thoughts on giving up but she continued to fight through it and hopes others will do the same no matter how hard it gets. She will be majoring in nursing to become a pediatric nurse. Sharon hopes one day she will open her own organization later on in life to help students like herself bloom and pursue their dream of going into a higher education after high school. She believes that it wasn't the proper documentation or "papers" that defined her worth. It is her determination and eagerness to make something of herself, combined with the acceptance of her identity that giver her values. She hopes to set forth the pieces necessary for like minded invdividuals to come along and contribute to that puzzle until our society decides that there is no longer a need for its fulfillment.
Cesar T.
Guilford Technical Community College in Jamestown, NC
2021 scholar Cesar Torres Rodriguez plans on attending Guilford Technical Community College to major in construction management. Born in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, he later arrived in North Carolina at the age of 3. Raised by a single mother, he realized at a young age the huge sacrifice his mother made for him to have a better future in the United States. Cesar says, “I am very honored to be chosen by Pupusas for Education because this is an opportunity that allows me to pursue a higher education and use it to help others in my community.”
Guillermo Ernesto Escobar Menjivar
Wake Technical Community College in Raleigh, NC
2022 Scholar Guilermo immigrated to the United States with his mother and little sister at the age of 15 in 2018 from El Salvador. Moving to this country and leaving his father behind in El Salvador was one of the hardest and most traumatizing things that he had to do in his life. In his first year in high school, he challenged and pushed himself to learn English as fast as he could, shortly after he started to take college classes from Wake Tech. It was hard in high school for him because of having to adapt to a whole new language and coming across people who said to him that he was never going to
college because he wasn’t a resident. After high school Guilermo was able to attend his first year at Wake Technical Community College. He’s working full time in a restaurant making sushi and Asian food. Guilermo looks after his little sister while also helping her with school. After Wake Tech Guilermo is planning to go to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to study biomedical engineering and plans to further his education in medical school. In the future, Guilermo wants a job where he can help people. He feels like after what he’s lived through, he wants to dedicate his whole life to helping people that need help.

At the start of 8th grade she moved to North Carolina it was the 1st time of a significant change took place in her life. It was challenging for her she was having difficulties in school. High school came along and she was thinking about giving up and just not going anymore since she is undocumented and she thought that she would never reach her goal of becoming a teacher. Jhoselyn started to give up but her family and teachers started to work with her. Her 9th-grade P.E. Coach and resource officers were always motivating her to keep going.
