What do they say?
"There comes a point in life where each of us has to decide what kind of person, family or organization we choose to be. I found at AESARA Foundation, a chance to push myself to give beyond what I thought was possible. I found a group of people committed to being a good neighbor to those who cross our path."
Ohene Asare
AESARA Board
"AESARA Foundation strives to empower others by listening, learning, and supporting their needs. The endeavors of AESARA Foundation start from a place of humility, and an underlying belief that people want to be successful and solve their own problems. AESARA Foundation sponsors that path to success."
Jen L. Kelley
AESARA Board
"'Think good, speak good, do good‚Äô is a mantra that infuses my daily living. AESARA I AESARA Foundation is my place that fuels this philosophy both professionally and philanthropically. Being connected to human lives in need and being able to fulfill that need is one of the most rewarding things I‚Äôve experienced. I encourage everyone to find your own passion of giving and ‚Äòdo good‚Äô."
Pamela M. Read
AESARA Board
"Congratulations to you in particular for spearheading such a wonderful project & getting all of us involved to get it funded & see it to fruition. We're honored to be a part of the project and to work with everyone involved.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am speechless. Incredibly opportune.
Thanks to you and BBF many lives will be saved in my town. Forever in debt with you.
Thank you."
Luis Daniel Pizarro
Municipio De Loiza
‚ÄúVolunteering should, by its virtue, have no expected return on investment. Yet our time in Lo√≠za volunteering with AESARA paid a quantifiable ROI.‚Äù
Michael Carlson
Volunteer
‚ÄúThe people of Loiza know a little more about
the generosity and caring of their fellow Americans. Can't wait for the next opportunity."
Jonathan A. Wright
Volunteer
‚ÄúSissi, what a wonderful surprise to see this extraordinary project come to fruition. You and your team are nothing short of amazing to have overcome all the obstacles and recruited the team needed for success. I can't express how satisfied all of us at BurlPres and the hundreds of individual donors we represent are to have helped put this permanent asset in place for Loiza.‚Äù
Todd Bower
Burlingame Presbyterian Church
"I was amazed to see the kindness multiply and our painting crew grew. First came the people on vacation, then some home owners, then people from other non-profits. The butterfly effect was real!"
Lei Zhu
AESARA Family
"The AESARA Foundation service trip to Loiza was in a way a life changing moment in time for us. We went down to help but we in turn were given a gift. We were so warmly welcomed into the homes, hearts and community - we were given so much from those who had lost so much in the hurricanes."
Susan and Berni
AESARA Family
"At the most critical time in the history of Restaurant Provence, the AESARA Foundation, led by Sissi Pham, showed the importance of community support.
We were sure not to survive this pandemic, but with their generous donation, after over four months we are still able to operate and keep all our staff on the payroll.
Thank you, from all of Provence staff!"
Baptist Knaven
AESARA Family
"We laid a house of ceramic tile for a family with a blind daughter whose house was destroyed by the hurricane. Since the hurricane, they were living in one bedroom with no kitchen and no bathroom. Even after putting in very hard and long days, it was still difficult to leave each day knowing we were so close to putting their lives somewhat back to normal."
