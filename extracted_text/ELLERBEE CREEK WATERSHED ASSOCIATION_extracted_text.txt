Creek Together
Who We Are
The Ellerbe Creek Watershed Association is a nonprofit working to restore a healthy, living creek that connects people and nature in Durham. We protected our first six acres in 1999. Since then, we have acquired more than 450 acres, including five nature preserves that we manage for public recreation, water quality, and native plant and habitat restoration.

Our Vision For the Future
ECWA's vision is a living creek connecting human and natural communities in Durham. Through land acquisition, collaboration with the city, and public education, we hope to create a Durham where residents can bike or walk across the watershed and stop at local businesses and nature preserves along the way.
Learn About Our Impact
Visit an Ellerbe Creek Nature Preserve
17-Acre Wood
The Association's first preserve, 17-Acre Wood actually covers 20 acres of floodplain forest. The trail and preserve serve as refuge for native plants rescued from development sites elsewhere in the watershed.
Beaver Marsh
Located between Club Boulevard and Interstate 85, Beaver Marsh is a beautiful oasis of green in an otherwise highly urbanized environment.
Glennstone
Glennstone Nature Preserve is an 83-acre woodland with about three miles of walking trails that connect to Falls Lake Game Lands and Ellerbe Creek.
Pearl Mill
The Pearl Mill Nature Preserve is part of a corridor of wetlands and floodplain woods that surround the East Branch of the South Ellerbe Creek.
The Rocks
The Rocks Nature Preserve is a 2 acre woodland along a scenic, rocky stretch of Ellerbe Creek. ​
Named after its unique geology, The Rocks is special among ECWA nature preserves.
