Sidewalk Opera
Sidewalk Opera brings classical music directly to your community.
No black ties necessary.
At Sidewalk Opera, we are not just passionate about music. We are passionate about community, too.
We believe that music has a unique and invaluable power to touch lives. Because of this, we hope to increase the accessibility of music by bringing it directly to doorsteps and sidewalks in local communities.
No concert tickets. No fees. Just music. That's our mission.
Based in Durham, NC, we travel to local businesses, schools, and other locations within surrounding communities, and we share the music we truly enjoy. We hope you enjoy it, too.
If you wish to chip in at any of our performances, a percentage of our proceeds goes toward providing music lessons and instruments for low-income families via the Sidewalk Opera Fund.
We hope to see you on the sidewalk soon!
Holiday Event!
Sidewalk Opera is proud to team with Brain Mugs & Brew, a Durham-based 501(c)3 organization, through the end of 2021. All coffee and mug sales go toward the Sidewalk Opera Fund, which provides musical instruments for lower-income families. Follow the link below!
