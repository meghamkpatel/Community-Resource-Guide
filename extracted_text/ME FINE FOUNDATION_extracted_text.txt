Our Mission
T
o provide hope through emotional support and financial assistance to families whose children are receiving care at North Carolina partner hospitals.
A family is hit with a medical crisis with one of their children
Considerable financial and emotional burdens begin to pile up
The family needs help ‚Äî right now ‚Äî from those who care
How we help
Building strength through financial and emotional support
Me Fine serves as an emergency safety net for families who are experiencing stress from a child‚Äôs medical crisis. Our two primary program areas help families boost their resilience at a time when they need it most.
Financial Support
At Me Fine, our scope of assistance encompasses any treatment-related need that a family experiences, from overdue utility bills and mortgage/rent payments to groceries and medically necessary equipment not covered by insurance. Me Fine is flexible and responsive: Our referral process takes mere minutes, and assistance can often be provided the same day, without requiring any additional effort from already-stressed parents.
Emotional Support
To address the challenges families face in a holistic way, Me Fine began sponsoring emotional and psychosocial support programs at our partner hospitals in 2013. These programs are designed to help pediatric patients, siblings, and parents process their experiences, tell their stories and find moments of joy and play during a child‚Äôs treatment.
Who we support
Who‚Äôs eligible for support from Me Fine
Here are the three criteria the team at Me Fine uses when considering every referral that comes our way:
The pediatric patient is currently in a medical crisis.
We consider a medical crisis to be a new diagnosis or sudden change in medical condition that dramatically impacts the family system.
The family‚Äôs financial need is due to the child's treatment.
Families often experience a wide range of financial stressors, so our specific mission is to assist families with financial distress that is directly caused by and related to their child's active treatment for a medical crisis.
The child is being cared for at a Me Fine Referral Partner site.
Me Fine works closely with hospital staff (including clinical social workers, care managers, and child life specialists) at our three partner hospitals in Central North Carolina: Duke Children‚Äôs, UNC Children‚Äôs, and WakeMed Children‚Äôs.
Partner Hospitals
We‚Äôre proud to receive referrals from three hospitals in central North Carolina that each have well-deserved reputations for excellence in caring for children and their families.

Become a Sustainer
Folden‚Äôs Friends
Join our community of monthly donors who recognize there are no days off when a child is ill.
The illness of a child is something that families have to face day in and day out over many months and years. There are no days off. Me Fine Founder, Lori Lee, knew this well when her son Folden spent so much time in and out of hospitals being treated for leukemia. Recognizing the need for the ongoing support of families like hers was what inspired her to create Me Fine.
This continued need for support is why we created Folden‚Äôs Friends. By agreeing to donate a set amount each month, you are acknowledging the constant struggle families are facing each and every day.¬† Your support throughout the year allows Me Fine to provide consistent and sustained financial and emotional support of our local families in need.

Me Fine‚Äôs Commitment to Equity
Families come first.
For sixteen years, the Me Fine Foundation has been led by this value. We serve families facing a variety of challenges independent of their child‚Äôs medical situation. Yet invariably, we see families of color carrying much larger burdens. Me Fine stands in solidarity against the long history of racism and oppression in our country, and we are committed to doing the work. Read Me Fine‚Äôs full Commitment to Equity
