Vets To Vets United
Improving lives, saving lives,
one veteran and one dog at a time
What We Do
1
Improve Lives
Significantly improve a veteran's life by providing loving, life-long companionship with interventions that can improve a veteran's mental and physical health.
2
Save Lives
Save the life of a high-risk animal that would otherwise face death since North Carolina has one of the highest euthanasia rates in the country.
3
Promote Community
Promote a healthier, more productive community through visits to local veteran service facilities, community senior centers and schools.
