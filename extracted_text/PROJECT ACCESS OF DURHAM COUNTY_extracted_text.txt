Vision
Project Access of Durham County envisions every Durham County resident will have access to quality health care in an environment that fosters health and wellbeing.
Mission
Our mission is to improve the health of uninsured and underserved Durham County residents. We provide access to an organized system of comprehensive care and collaborate with community partners to address barriers to health.
Donated Specialty Care Network
PADC links people without health insurance into a local network of clinics, laboratories, pharmacies, and hospitals that donate their efforts to help those in need. We serve eligible low-income, uninsured Durham residents who have specialty medical care needs.
Durham Homeless Care Transitions
The Medical Respite Pilot, which PADC helped create, expanded to become DHCT in 2016. This project helps homeless persons being discharged from hospitals to connect to health care, benefits, housing, and other supports.
Health Equipment Loan Program
PADC launched HELP in 2016 at The Scrap Exchange to recycle, restore, and loan for reuse durable medical equipment to any Durham County resident.
Community Health Worker Initiative
We collaborate with partner organizations to provide trainings and resources to Community Health Workers (CHWs) and Community Health Promoters (CHPs)
