who we are
Do you love the arts? We do too. As the hub for arts and culture in Durham, our vision is to make art a daily presence in our community.
For over 60 years, we’ve been supporting local art and the artists who create it — as well as the people who enjoy it — through programs, services, classes, and exhibits.
DAC Serves the Arts Sector
How we do it: Supporting, showcasing and employing arts organizations and artists — around 2,000 artists and 300 arts and cultural organizations served each year.
What that means for you: artist and arts organization grants, exhibit space, performance/rehearsal/office space
