Over the last 13 years,
RELANC
has positively impacted your law practice.  In some form or fashion, you and
RELANC
have crossed paths, likely by attending a call-in webinar, a conference, CLE, or other event designed for North Carolina attorneys practicing in the residential and/or commercial real estate sector. Even if you have not had that direct contact,
RELANC
has been present in the legislature fighting for you and your clients.
The Real Estate Lawyers Association of North Carolina
, a 500+ member 501(c)6 nonprofit, advocates on behalf of real estate attorneys and their clients, the property-owning public.
RELANC
gives voice to real estate attorneys, addressing the constant change and evolution of ethical representation and client protection.  Recent areas of focus include e-closings, mechanics lien legislation, cyber-fraud and cyber security, AVVO discussions, recording fees, and NC-SC boundary line matters.  One of the biggest issues facing our bar is the Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL), in which
RELANC
has become a major force towards detecting and fighting – both the LegalZoom matter and more recent and pervasive UPL occurring in your local communities.
In 2024, RELANC continues to be concerned about electronic closing and notary legislation and policymaking that will continue to be a focus of our lobbyist Jim Harrell’s efforts in the NC General Assembly, and of course we are deeply concerned about the necessary work to be done so that the Odyssey system and e-filing in North Carolina can be as suitable for the practice of real estate law as it is for our colleagues in other practice areas. We also continue to actively monitor, research, document, and report situations of the Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL), as they are brought to our attention.
Please check out our
Areas of Concern & Action
page for a more robust description of what we do and how you can find us in action.
RELANC
also has a membership stake in several industry-wide groups such as the NC Land Records Taskforce, which influences state-wide road matters and other issues that involve a variety of constituencies such as the Secretary of State and Register of Deeds offices. These liaisons and partnerships are a key element of
RELANC’s
work. In a few short years, RELANC has become an active, sought-after participant in these organizations.
RELANC
is the voice in Raleigh for real estate attorneys.
RELANC
is the only organization with a lobbyist in Raleigh at the legislature to protect you and your clients.
About Us
RELANC is a 501 (C) 6 nonprofit organization comprised of real estate closing attorneys, short sale and REO attorneys, title counselors, and litigators. Members come from all over the state of North Carolina to share a common vision focused on defending, developing and defining ethical and viable real estate business practices. RELANC is first and foremost committed to defending consumers who purchase real property in North Carolina. This advocacy focus is what differentiates RELANC from the other outstanding trade associations in North Carolina; we answer only to our members and our clients, the property-owning and -buying public.
