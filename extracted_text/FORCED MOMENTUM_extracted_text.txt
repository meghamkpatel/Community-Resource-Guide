What are the definitions of things like moments, momentum, force, energy
Hi, recently started learning physics and I'm really confused with what these things are trying to measure exactly and how we know they are equal to the things they way they are. E.g. what exactly is a force, I know it's equal to mass*acceleration and that's it, what is it trying to measure exactly and why does that definition mean it is equal to mass*acceleration. I have the same question for the other things like momentum, moments, and energy. I know these are equal to things, but I don't understand what they are trying to measure and how we know they are equal to what we say they are?
