A Message from your President-Elect,
Hello Esteemed Phi Pi Members and thank you for being a nurse,
This week as we celebrate National Nurses day and week, it makes me wonder if there is a "National Day" for every day of the year. The answer is yes, there is a national holiday for every day of the year. Some of those that I find most memorable are National Buffet Day on January 2
nd
(who doesn't like a good buffet) and September 1
st
National Burnt Ends Day (for those of you who like that part of the Brisket), and finally shortly after nurse's week on May 13
th
there is National Frog Jumping Day. With so many 'special days' each year, It may be tough to get excited about them all ---However, I hope today and this week, you will celebrate being a nurse. We are a strong and proud professional and the backbone of our healthcare system. As the largest group of healthcare professionals and the most honest and ethical profession, I hope you celebrate today. While we also have one of the most demanding professions, I hope you still find it rewarding. I challenge everyone this week---do something nice for a nurse, yourself, or a co-worker.
And for those of you who want to tell us something special about you and nursing, please send an email and your picture to our communications director Allison, we'd like to highlight you on our upcoming newsletters and social media. Email Allison at "communication@phipi.org". I look forward to learning more about you!
And if you have a tough nurses' week this year, just remember this too shall pass, and there is always National Dance Like a Chicken Day on May 14th.
Cheers to you and thank you for caring enough about your profession to be a member of the Sigma International Honor Society of Nursing!
In care,
LeAnne Prenovost
President-Elect
