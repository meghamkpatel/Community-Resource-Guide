RESTORE
Celebrate History
The rustic wedding venue in NC was built by Guilford Nanny, known for building the stairs up to Chimney Rock State Park. The farm dates back to the early 1900s and was a landmark where locals came to buy their meat, cheese, and milk. New Beginnings Historic Farm has been restored to its historical roots as a working farm where many in the community gather.
