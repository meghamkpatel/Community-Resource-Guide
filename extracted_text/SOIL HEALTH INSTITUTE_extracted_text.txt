Enriching Soil, Enhancing Life
Enriching soil enhances life from the microscopic scale to the global scale. Adopting soil health systems can increase microbial diversity, improve farmer livelihood, increase agricultural productivity, and build climate resilience. As a result, downstream communities receive cleaner water, ecosystem health is restored, rural landscapes are sustained, and climate change is held in check for future generations.
Our Strategy
Soil Health is the Foundation for Regenerative Agriculture
Across North America and around the globe, the Soil Health Institute is advancing the science of soil health. Our work is focused on strategic goals to scale adoption of soil health management systems - the foundation for regenerative agriculture. Discover more about our initiatives.
Initiatives
Recommended Measurements for Scaling Soil Health Assessment
Measuring management-induced changes in soil health can provide insight into farmersâ progress at establishing more regenerative systems and guide selection of alternative practices that increase profitability, resilience, and ecosystem services. The Soil Health Institute recommends a minimum suite of three measurements to be widely applied across North America. Discover more about why these measurements were selected and how to quantitatively measure and monitor soil health.
