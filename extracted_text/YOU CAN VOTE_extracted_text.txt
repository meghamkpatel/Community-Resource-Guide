About
You Can Vote (YCV) trains and mobilizes volunteers to educate, register, and empower all North Carolina citizens to successfully cast their ballot. As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, YCV is an organized and effective non-partisan campaign to increase voter registration and voter turnout for people facing barriers to full civic participation. It is a campaign without a candidate. This means that You Can Vote does NOT work for a candidate or a party. And it does NOT mobilize around specific issues (e.g. environment, education). You Can Vote is an ongoing, non-partisan effort to increase voter registration and voter turnout.

“The presentation on registering to vote by You Can Vote is valuable across all disciplines! Not only does this quick session make it easy for students to register to vote, but it’s also a great reminder of our responsibility to participate in the democratic process!”
— Hubert Womack & Rosalind Tedford, WFU ZSR Library
