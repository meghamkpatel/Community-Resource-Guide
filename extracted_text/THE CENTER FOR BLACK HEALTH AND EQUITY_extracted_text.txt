WE FIGHT FOR OUR LIVES
At The Center for Black Health & Equity, we understand that the first step to mobilizing health organizations and communities is to become aware of the root causes of health disparities among Black Americans.
The Center works to abolish the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS, increase health and food literacy, fighting the tobacco industry's unethical marketing tactics, and reverse the impact that institutional racism has had on the health of Black people.
