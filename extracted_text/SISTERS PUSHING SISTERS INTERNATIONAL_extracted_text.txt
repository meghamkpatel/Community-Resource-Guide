1 Peter 4:8
Love covers a multitude of sins, according to the scriptures. Love covering sin does not mean we disregard our own emotions or ignore our personal boundaries. We cannot “cover” sin by denying that it hurt us. We cover sin by acknowledging it and then extending the forgiveness God has given us to others. Some sins against us are not worth confronting. Personal slights, snide or ignorant remarks, and minor annoyances can be easily forgiven for the sake of love.
Another way that love covers over a multitude of sins is choosing not to take offense at everything. This does not give you a free pass to hurt someone and use the clause that "love covers a multitude of sins." Another thing love does is protect (1 Corinthians 13:7). Love does not cover over a multitude of sin by sweeping matters under the rug. Some have appealed to the forgiving nature of love in their attempt to hide indiscretion. For example, rather than report child abuse, a church might cover it up. This is not what true love does. Love protects by helping both the victim and the offender, and it also strives to prevent further offenses. God is concerned about all parties involved. God desire is that we all come into the knowledge of the truth through forgiveness, salvation and healing.
