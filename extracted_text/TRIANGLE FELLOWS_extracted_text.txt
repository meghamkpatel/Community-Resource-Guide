About Us
Most of us spend 40% of our day and 90,000+ hours of our lives at work. As image bearers, we’re designed for good work that cultivates creation as well as loves our neighbors. Many days, however, we struggle with meaning/purpose and the “thorns” in the workplace. Our hearts wonder, “Does work matter?” We struggle to connect our faith and our work. We struggle to connect our Sunday to our Monday.
Triangle Fellows believes that the Gospel changes everything, including our work. We believe that our work participates in God’s mission and story of renewing all things. We envision a Durham and Chapel Hill where everyone is thriving. Our mission is to connect and cultivate Christian leaders to spend their lives for the good of the community.
About the Fellowship
Triangle Fellows leads a local chapter of the
Gotham Fellowship
, a 9-month, immersive discipleship program from Tim Keller’s church in NYC. Since its founding in 2008, the Gotham Fellowship has equipped Christians for Gospel leadership in the world. The fellowship facilitates renewal in our hearts, community, and world through elements of spiritual/personal development, theological training, community formation, and city/cultural engagement. We find that our work does matter. We connect our Sunday to our Monday. The fellowship extends from September to May. We form 10-15 member cohorts who journey through the following components…
Weekly Readings
Each week, we read through primary theological texts, guided devotionals, and spiritual formation practices.
Weekly Meetings
The Fellows meet for 3 hours on Monday evenings for discussions of the readings along with dinner, liturgies, stories, frameworks, and prayer.
Monthly Outings
Monthly Saturday morning outings into the city provide time with industry leaders and for in-depth exercises.
Weekend Retreats
Three retreats at the beginning, middle, and end of the program focus on deeper, personal reflection on the program and in community.
