Welcome to the Do Good Sisterhood
For 150 years, Delta Gamma has connected women of impact to champion one another as we continue to transform our connections into a lifetime of belonging. The unwavering bonds of our sisterhood are a life-long promise because the pursuit of doing good is never done.
We kicked off our sesquicentennial celebration at Convention 2022 and will celebrate through
Convention 2024
! Learn how you can celebrate, shop 150-merchandise, support the Anchoring the Future Campaign, connect with sisters at your local level and celebrate sisterhood throughout the biennium.
Learn More About Our Sesquicentennial
Article II of the Delta Gamma Constitution outlines the values that we hold true:
The objects of this Fraternity shall be to foster high ideals of friendship among women, to promote their educational and cultural interests, to create in them a true sense of social responsibility, and to develop in them the best qualities of character.
