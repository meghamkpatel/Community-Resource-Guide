The Astellas Global Health Foundation: Dedicated to Improving Access to Health, Building Resilient Communities and Providing Disaster Support in Underserved Global Communities
Who We Are
The Astellas Global Health Foundation ("Foundation")  is an international philanthropic organization focused on helping to build "One World, A Healthier Tomorrow."
The Foundation's efforts are focused on reducing significant unmet medical needs and health access issues facing global communities that are not equitably served by healthcare infrastructure to help make a sustainable impact on the health of people around the world.
What We Do
Less than half of the global population has access to essential health services [World Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank,2021].
1
The Foundation supports initiatives that address barriers to access to health, including lack of available treatments, insufficient healthcare infrastructure and healthcare information. The Foundation also funds efforts that help to build healthier, resilient communities and provide disaster support (preparedness and relief).
The Foundationâs funding supports philanthropic initiatives In low- and middle-income countries where Astellas, the corporation, does not have a business presence. Programs that receive funding are designed and implemented by charitable/non-profit organizations in alignment with the Foundationâs Social Contribution Policy and UN Sustainable Development Goals.The Foundation does not accept unsolicited proposals or requests for funding.
Success is defined by the Foundationâs ability to make a meaningful impact by supporting partner initiatives that actively contribute to the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals,particularly Goal 3:
Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.

Our Focus Areas:
Improving access to health:
Strengthening health infrastructure as well as enhancing availability of healthcare for: (1) mental health; (2) neglected tropical and communicable disease care and treatment (e.g., HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, among others); and (3) childrenâs health; to help make a positive long-term impact on the worldâs most vulnerable populations.
Building community resilience:
Proactively tackling major health challenges and minimizing avoidable deaths through infrastructure strengthening, systems improvements and training initiatives.
Providing disaster support:
Helping to improve: (1) preparedness, surveillance and response and reduce suffering caused by natural disasters (e.g., creating data and information collection systems that will monitor health risks posed by natural disasters); (2) surveillance and monitoring of biological emergencies (e.g., potential health threats, such as COVID-19, and potential health threats, such as SARS, influenza and cholera); and (3) initiatives that otherwise provide disaster support through preparedness, surveillance and/or response.
