Welcome to NorthEast Forsyth Youth Lacrosse
Our 501(c)(3) non profit recreational lacrosse program is the official feeder program for the North and East Forsyth High School's' Men’s & Women’s Lacrosse Teams.
Our mission is to develop each player to their full lacrosse potential, accommodating players of all skill levels.  We focus on improving each player's lacrosse "IQ" and ensure players are learning the right way to play.  We employ game strategies that leverage advanced player’s skills while ensuring equitable play time for all players.  We respect the dignity of every player and seek ways to help them recognize their own strength and self-worth.
We field numerous youth teams, Kindergarten thru 8th grade, with Fall and Spring Seasons generally spanning Aug-Oct and Jan-Apr.
