At a time when the right-wing holds power in our state and far too many campaigns overlook the importance of long-term investment in local communities, we are developing a bold approach to organizing and voter engagement for North Carolina. By unleashing the full potential of our diverse communities we can create real change in the lives of our people, win elections that were previously unwinnable and transform the political terrain.

Our goal is a fundamental shift in the policies and rules that govern our state. We are building an independent political movement that forges a new political and economic agenda for North Carolina, rooted in a culture of dignity and belonging. Through our organizing, we can build permanent, progressive majorities at the local and state level.
A Commitment

Our approach to building power is defined by our relentless commitment to bringing new people into political action, our deep investment in local leadership, and our intentional integration of cultural work with community and electoral organizing.
Together we will realize the promise of a democracy that is truly of, by, and for all people.
Building a politics of ALL OF US.
