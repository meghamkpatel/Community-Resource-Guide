Peyton Strickland (Source: Nick Kane)
WILMINGTON, NC (WECT) – It's been more than six years since a student was shot and killed by deputies in his home, and UNCW just released a statement relating to the Cape Fear Community College student's death.
Peyton Strickland's family
filed a lawsuit with the State Industrial Commission several years ago
, blaming UNCW and police for a hasty and over-zealous investigation.
The statement released by UNCW
on Thursday says that lawsuit has been resolved.
The university said in the statement that it would provide money to the charitable work of the Peyton Brooks Strickland Foundation. It also agreed to allocate $100,000 to an account that will be used to provide higher accreditation to the university's police department. It will pay for accreditation from the Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies.
The statement from the university said this will help to set apart the university's accreditation from other institutions.
Strickland was shot and killed after a sheriff's deputy mistakenly opened fire during a raid
on his home in December of 2006. Sheriff deputies suspected the teenager had stolen a pair of Playstation 3's.
