Stuart Bradley works with his younger brother Jamie at the local convenience store, Right Buy U, while his pregnant
fiancée
Amy squanders his money. Under pressure to find their own place, Stuart concocts a plan with a wayward Jamie to rob the store. However, things go dramatically wrong when the kindly manager, Bob, interrupts them, and Jamie unnecessarily hits him over the head with a bottle of whisky. He is rushed to hospital in a critical state, while DCI Newell of the Yorkshire police begins investigating. Things are thrown another curveball when, along with the other members of the syndicate, Stuart learns that they have won the lottery. And in a twist of fate, his share of the money relies on Bob's vote, as he hasn't paid his money for the last 5 weeks. Meanwhile, Leanne shies away from the camera at a press conference; what is she hiding?

Pregnant Dawn Stevenson and her 17-year-old diabetic daughter Amy work as maids at run-down Hazelwood Manor, along with cook Julie and her daughter, manageress Sarah, gardener Godfrey and handyman Sean. The owner of the manor, Lord Charles Hazelwood is kind-hearted and very loyal to his staff, but has been rendered invalid by a stroke, and the household is run by his imperious, self-centred wife, Rachel and his more down-to-earth money-haemmorhage of a stepson, Spencer (with whom Amy is having an affair). Due to the expense of maintaining the property and the family being more than six million pounds in debt, the manor is now run on a skeleton staff, and can barely afford to pay a living wage. To bring in cash, the Hazelwoods host a party of visiting Americans and during their stay the six members of staff, who are members of a lottery syndicate, find that they have won fourteen million pounds. Whilst they are celebrating Amy disappears, having rowed with aggressive ex-boyfriend Nick.

The police start to recognise that there may be something more sinister to Amy's disappearance, and suspicion falls on the last person to see her, Godfrey. Godfrey, who has Asperger Syndrome, struggles to comprehend what is going on and why he is a suspect. They discover that Amy was using Godfrey's affection for her to get her own way, and Amy's father Andy lashes out at everyone around him. Meanwhile, Julie rallies the staff together with a proposition for a struggling Lord Hazelwood; they want to invest in Hazelwood Manor to ensure its future. Rachel and Spencer react with fury, having hoped he would go with the more substantial offer the Americans had made, but Charles is adamant that he would prefer to keep the manor in his family.

A journalist approaches the Stevensons with the news that Sean has a big secret; he is on the sex offenders register, having done three years for statutory rape. Andy once again lashes out, while Sarah is devastated by the prospect that Sean is not who he says he is. Sean eventually tells the full story – some years previously, when he worked as a mounted police officer in his native Scotland, he had unknowingly entered into a relationship with an underage girl named Mary Campbell (who bears a striking resemblance to Amy) doing her Duke of Edinburgh community service, who had lied about her age. Upon learning she was only 15, he had tried to end the relationship, but had been unable to, and the two had tried to run away. The incident had cost him his career in the police, and destroyed his relationship with his family – only Lord Hazelwood had been willing to offer him work. Meanwhile, Charles learns that some of his paintings have been swapped for fakes, and turns on his wife with his suspicions.

Nick resurfaces and the police question him on Amy's disappearance. Meanwhile, at the Manor, the Hazelwoods' marriage is more strained than ever. Rachel holds a lavish party to celebrate her 25th Wedding Anniversary, hiring caterers that clash with Julie and the rest of the staff, and the Americans make Charles an offer twice the size of the staff's for the land around the manor. He once again refuses, and seeks to revoke Rachel's Power of Attorney. Just as the Hazelwood's marriage seems at rock bottom, Julie makes a surprise revelation; Rachel has been having an affair for years with the family solicitor. Sarah makes a discovery which leaves her deeply suspicious of her mother. As he enters the caravan in which he lives, Nick is shot from behind.

Sarah and Sean investigate the antique clock they have discovered in Julie's possession, and find that it went missing from Hazelwood Manor 3 years ago. When they confront her, Rachel learns of the discovery and confronts her husband, with the intent to get him to change his mind about the Syndicate's offer. To her shock, Charles reveals that he gave it to Julie as a gift when her husband had died, and also reveals that they had had a brief affair shortly after his first wife's death. Sarah is devastated by the thought of her mother betraying her recently deceased father and turns to Sean for comfort. Charles goes to Julie to apologise for upsetting Sarah, and admits that he has wished for some time that they could have made a go of their relationship. To his shock, she makes a surprise revelation of her own; that her late husband was infertile, and that Charles is actually Sarah's biological father. With evidence that she has been selling her husband's paintings mounting, and their marriage in pieces, a dejected Rachel leaves the manor for good. Spencer resurfaces and faces questions from the police, while Andy comes under suspicion from both the police and Dawn following Nick's shooting.

On the day of Hazelwood Manor's grand opening, Amy suddenly turns up, alive and reasonably unharmed, to Dawn's shock and intense relief. She explains the full story of her disappearance: After separating from her mother at Hazelwood Manor, she had been picked up by Nick and returned with him to his caravan. He had become forceful with her, but had been rescued by Spencer, who had gone after her. While making a pit stop on the way back to the manor, Amy's low blood sugar caused her to fall and injured herself, so he had taken her to his yacht instead, and seeing an opportunity, had taken a photo of her in her injured state, acquired an emergency insulin pen and, using lies and the pen, tricked her into staying there with the intent to steal Dawn's lottery winnings, sign Amy up with his American friend Tyler's modelling label, and take her to new heights with him as her manager. Upon catching on that she is missing at home, Amy had eventually escaped the yacht and gone to find her mother. Spencer is arrested when he turns up at Hazelwood Manor to look for Amy. Meanwhile, Charles tries to convince Julie to confess to Sarah her true parentage, which would allow him to name her as a beneficiary to his family trust and prevent his wife from claiming a share on the manor in their upcoming divorce. When Julie flip-flops, he eventually reveals the truth to her himself, and she reacts with horror, anger and feelings of betrayal. Eventually, though, Amy's reappearance and a heartfelt conversation with Lord Hazelwood, who confesses that he still loves her mother, brings her round. As the celebrations at Hazelwood Manor commence, Dawn suddenly goes into labour at home, and as her family take her to hospital, she sends her son to find Amy. Unbeknownst to them, Amy has given them the slip and gone to find Tyler – who, it is revealed, had helped Amy escape Spencer, and is now her boyfriend. It is also revealed that they had stolen the money from Spencer's account, and are now on their way to the airport, bound for America, leaving Spencer to face potential charges of false imprisonment.
