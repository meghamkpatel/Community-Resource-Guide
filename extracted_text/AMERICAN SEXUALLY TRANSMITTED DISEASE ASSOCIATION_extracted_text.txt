To recognize outstanding contributions in STI control and prevention
To disseminate authoritative information concerning STI
To develop the current and future generations of STI professionals

ASSOCIATION COMMITMENTS
We demand rigorous science adhering to the highest ethical standards.
We promote a sex-positive sexual health framework.
We are committed to an STI workforce and ASTDA membership comprised of professionals with a wide range of roles and experiences.
We value a culture of inclusion, equity, safety, professionalism, and respect.

OUR WORK
STD Journal
Sexually Transmitted Diseases
, our flagship journal, is one of the leading venues in the world for cutting-edge basic and clinical science. We publish peer-reviewed, original articles on clinical, laboratory, immunologic, epidemiologic, behavioral, public health, and historical topics pertaining to sexually transmitted diseases and related fields. ASTDA members receive a subscription to the journal as a benefit of membership.
STD Conferences
ASTDA has served as a co-sponsor and key organizer of such conferences as the biannual STD Prevention Conference, the HIV Diagnostics Conference, and will be the organizer of the
25th ISSTDR & 24th World IUSTI Meeting in 2023
. ASTDA members receive reduced registration for the biannual STD Prevention Conference. Joint ASTDA & IUSTI members also receive reduced registration fees at most IUSTI regional and world meetings.
Career Development
ASTDA is committed to rejuvenating the STD workforce and providing career development opportunities for young investigators and fostering the academic careers of young investigators and encouraging their enthusiasm for our field. As part of this commitment, ASTDA and
Sexually Transmitted Diseases
created an award to recognize excellence in STD-related research by a young investigator. This award is the
Best STD Paper by a Young Investigator
, presented annually at the ASTDA awards ceremonies.
Collaboration
ASTDA has strong collaborative relationships with other organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the National Coalition of STD Directors, the American Sexual Health Association, and the National Prevention & Training Centers, among others.
