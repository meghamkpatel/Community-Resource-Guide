LOCATION
CENTRAL
AT RDU
WELCOME
Raleigh Flying Club hopes to make flying more accessible for Triangle-area pilots. By having a central Triangle location, reasonable fees and aircraft accessibility, we encourage pilots to fly more often and make it possible for aspiring pilots to reach their goals. You can learn to fly in club airplanes then once licensed you can continue to fly the airplanes that you learned in. Or move up to other great cross country airplanes.
BOOK YOUR INTRO FLIGHT!
Discover what it’s like to pilot one of our airplanes with an instructor from RDU. You’ll get 60 minutes in the airplane, 30 minutes of ground instruction, and a complementary logbook. Book for yourself or as a gift! $247 complete.
