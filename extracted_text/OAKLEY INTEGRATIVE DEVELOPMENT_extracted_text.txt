Master Planned Affordable Housing Development
To address the City of Oakley’s lack of affordable housing stock, ICD was selected from a group of affordable housing developers to master plan the construction of 535 affordable housing units on a 16.75 acre site. The City of Oakley was incorporated in 2001 and has been the fastest growing single family housing market in Northern California.
The Oakley Master Planned affordable housing community consists of six (soon to be seven) developments for both seniors and families. The community also contains the Oak tree park preservation space, a beautiful 5 acre oak tree preserve.
