Upcoming Meetings
We understand how much members value the opportunity to meet together – and the difficulties they and their campuses are experiencing in the wake of the pandemic. We are continuing to monitor the situation to determine when it may be possible to return to in-person meetings – and to develop virtual capabilities to support your work in the meantime. We will keep you updated as things unfold.
Here is information about the meetings we currently have scheduled.
