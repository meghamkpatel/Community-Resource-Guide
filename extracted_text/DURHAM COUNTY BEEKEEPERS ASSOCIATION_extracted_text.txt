DCBA
Durham County Beekeepers Association was formed by a small cluster of Durham beekeepers in 2011. This eager group began to share knowledge, collaborate, and grow.
Meetings of the club take place every third Monday of the month at 7:00pm. Currently we meet in person at the
Sarah P Duke Gardens
. Meetings are open to the public – no need to be a member.
We have an apiary at the
Duke Campus Farm
, and there we give members and visitors alike a chance to observe and participate in beekeeping.
Please join our
DCBA Google group
to participate in online discussions and get notified about our monthly meetings.
