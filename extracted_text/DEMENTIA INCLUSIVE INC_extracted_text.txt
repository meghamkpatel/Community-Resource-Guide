strengthening
community accountability
to promote

supports and services
for people living with
dementia
and their care

Dementia
Inclusive Inc.
"
Dementia has physical, psychological, social and economic impacts
locally and globally
, not only for people living with dementia, but also for their carers, families and
society at large
. There is often a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia, resulting in stigmatization and barriers to diagnosis and care."
— WHO
Dementia affects millions of people and communities across the globe. Persons living with dementia and their care partners shouldn't have to give up a meaningful, engaged life after diagnosis.
We aim to build a
community culture
of well-being, inclusion, health equity, and hope for persons at risk of or living with dementia and their care partners.
Creating this type of culture will require
all of us coming together.
We work with
various community sectors
to help ensure they are safe and inclusive spaces where folks living with dementia can continue to remain meaningfully engaged.
We believe 'community' means
everyone
. Our cities, countries, and the whole world are only made better by inclusion.
That's
why
we
care
,
and
you
should
too
.
