OUR STORY
Scott was born on July 17, 1994 in Longview, Texas. He was saved at the age of 4 under his father's preaching. He grew up in an evangelist's home, and spent a great amount of time on the road watching his father preach the Gospel. He was called to preach at the age of 16 while attending a youth
conference at the very same church where he was saved! God eventually moved Scott's dad, Pastor Scott Gray, to Durham, NC to pastor the Liberty Baptist Church while Scott was finishing at
Bible College
. This is where
Scott met his wife Allie, who grew up in that very church her entire life. She was saved at the age of 12, and was attending
Pensacola Christian College waiting to see what God had in store for her life. Scott and Allie both knew they were God's will for each other, and were married on June 23, 2017. They now have a
little boy, Emmitt, and two little girls, Katie and Sadie. They enjoy serving in full time evangelism sent out of Liberty Baptist Church. Scott is excited to
follow his call to preach, and asks that you pray for him as he follows God's leading in his life.

Pastor Scott Gray
Liberty Baptist Church

I have heard him preach, both to young
people
and our adult
congregation, and he exudes a calm wisdom that I wish I had shown at his young age.
Pastor CT Townsend
Victory Baptist Church

We have witnessed their character, integrity, and desire to serve the Lord. They would be a blessing and a great
help
to you and your local church.
Pastor Kurt Skelly

Church

The Lord has gifted Scottie with a
powerful blend of uncompromising biblical preaching and an excellent spirit.
Pastor Stephen Cox

I have watched him grow into a fine, balanced, grounded preacher. I highly recommend Scottie Gray to be used in your church.
Pastor Bob Gray II
Emmanuel Baptist

I recommend him to you not because he is my nephew but
because
he is truly a young man of God with a deep love for Christ with a desire to serve churches and help people.
