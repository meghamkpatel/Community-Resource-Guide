Sufism
(
Arabic
:
الصوفية‎
,
romanized
:
al-Ṣūfiyya
or
Arabic
:
التصوف‎
,
romanized
:
al-Taṣawwuf
) is a
mystic
body of religious practice found within
Islam
which is characterized by a focus on Islamic
purification
,
spirituality
,
ritualism
,
asceticism
, and
esotericism
.
[1]

[5]
Six Sufi masters,
c.
1760
Practitioners of Sufism are referred to as "Sufis" (from
صُوفِيّ
,
ṣūfīy
),
[6]
and historically typically belonged to "orders" known as
tariqa
(pl.
ṭuruq
) – congregations formed around a grand
wali
who would be the last in a
chain of successive teachers
linking back to
Muhammad
, with the goal of undergoing
tazkiya
(self purification) and the hope of reaching the
spiritual station
of
ihsan
.
[7]
[8]
[9]
The ultimate aim of Sufis is to seek the pleasure of God by endeavoring to return to their original state of purity and natural disposition, known as
fitra
.
[10]
Sufism emerged early on in
Islamic history
, partly as a reaction against the worldliness of the early
Umayyad Caliphate
(661–750) and mainly under the tutelage of
Hasan al-Basri
. Although Sufis were opposed to dry
legalism
, they strictly observed
Islamic law
and belonged to various schools of
Islamic jurisprudence
and
theology
.
[11]
Although the overwhelming majority of Sufis, both pre-modern and modern, remain adherents of
Sunni Islam
, certain strands of Sufi thought transferred over to the ambits of
Shia Islam
during the late medieval period.
[12]
This particularly happened after the
Safavid conversion of Iran
under the concept of
Irfan
.
[12]
Important focuses of Sufi worship include
dhikr
, the practice of remembrance of God. Sufis also played an important role in spreading Islam through their missionary and educational activities.
[11]
Despite a relative decline of Sufi orders in the
modern era
and attacks from
revivalist
Islamic movement
(such as the
Salafis
and
Wahhabis
), Sufism has continued to play an important role in the
Islamic world
, especially in the
neo-traditionalist
strand of Sunni Islam.
[13]
[14]
It has also influenced various forms of spirituality in the West and generated significant academic interest.
[15]
[16]
[17]
Definitions
[
edit
]
The Arabic word
tasawwuf
(
lit.
'
being or becoming a Sufi
'
), generally translated as Sufism, is commonly defined by Western authors as Islamic mysticism.
[18]
[19]
[20]
The Arabic term
Sufi
has been used in Islamic literature with a wide range of meanings, by both proponents and opponents of Sufism.
[18]
Classical Sufi texts, which stressed certain teachings and practices of the
Quran
and the
sunnah
(exemplary teachings and practices of the Islamic prophet
Muhammad
), gave definitions of
tasawwuf
that described ethical and spiritual goals
[note 1]
and functioned as teaching tools for their attainment. Many other terms that described particular spiritual qualities and roles were used instead in more practical contexts.
[18]
[19]
Some modern scholars have used other definitions of Sufism such as "intensification of Islamic faith and practice"
[18]
and "process of realizing ethical and spiritual ideals".
[19]
The term Sufism was originally introduced into European languages in the 18th century by Orientalist scholars, who viewed it mainly as an intellectual doctrine and literary tradition at variance with what they saw as sterile
monotheism
of Islam. It was often mistaken as a universal mysticism in contrast to legalistic orthodox Islam.
[21]
In recent times, Historian
Nile Green
has argued against such distinctions, stating, in the Medieval period Sufism and Islam were more or less the same.
[22]
In modern scholarly usage, the term serves to describe a wide range of social, cultural, political and religious phenomena associated with Sufis.
[19]
Sufism has been variously defined as "Islamic
mysticism
",
[23]
[24]
[25]
"the mystical expression of Islamic faith",
[26]
"the inward dimension of Islam",
[27]
[28]
"the phenomenon of mysticism within Islam",
[6]
[29]
the "main manifestation and the most important and central crystallization" of mystical practice in Islam,
[30]
[31]
and "the interiorization and intensification of Islamic faith and practice".
[32]
Etymology
[
edit
]
The original meaning of
ṣūfī
seems to have been "one who wears wool (
ṣūf
)", and the
Encyclopaedia of Islam
calls other etymological hypotheses "untenable".
[6]
[18]
Woolen clothes were traditionally associated with ascetics and mystics.
[6]
Al-Qushayri
and
Ibn Khaldun
both rejected all possibilities other than
ṣūf
on linguistic grounds.
[33]
Another explanation traces the lexical root of the word to
ṣafā
(
صفاء
), which in Arabic means "purity", and in this context another similar idea of
tasawwuf
as considered in Islam is
tazkiyah
(
تزكية
, meaning: self-purification), which is also widely used in Sufism. These two explanations were combined by the Sufi
al-Rudhabari
(d. 322 AH), who said, "The Sufi is the one who wears wool on top of purity."
[34]
[35]
Others have suggested that the word comes from the term
Ahl al-Ṣuffa
("the people of the
suffah
or the bench"), who were a group of impoverished companions of Muhammad who held regular gatherings of
dhikr
,
[36]
one of the most prominent companion among them was
Abu Hurayra
. These men and women who sat at
al-Masjid an-Nabawi
are considered by some to be the first Sufis.
[37]
[38]
History
[

Main article:
History of Sufism
Origins
[
edit
]
The current consensus is that Sufism emerged in the
Hejaz
, and that it has existed as a practice of
Muslims
from the earliest days of Islam, even predating some sectarian divides.
[39]
Sufi orders are based on the
bayah
(
Arabic
:
بَيْعَة
,
lit.
'pledge') that was given to Muhammad by his
Ṣahabah
. By pledging allegiance to Muhammad, the Sahabah had committed themselves to the service of God.
[40]
[41]
[42]
Verily, those who give Bay'âh (pledge) to you (O Muhammad) they are giving Bay'âh (pledge) to
God
. The Hand of God is over their hands. Then whosoever breaks his pledge, breaks it only to his own harm, and whosoever fulfils what he has covenanted with God, He will bestow on him a great reward. — [Translation of Quran
48:10
]
Sufis believe that by giving
bayʿah
(pledging allegiance) to a legitimate Sufi
Shaykh
, one is pledging allegiance to Muhammad; therefore, a spiritual connection between the seeker and Muhammad is established. It is through Muhammad that Sufis aim to learn about, understand and connect with God.
[43]
Ali is regarded as one of the major figures amongst the
Sahaba
who have directly pledged allegiance to Muhammad, and Sufis maintain that through Ali, knowledge about Muhammad and a connection with Muhammad may be attained. Such a concept may be understood by the
hadith
, which Sufis regard to be authentic, in which Muhammad said, "I am the city of knowledge, and Ali is its gate."
[44]
Eminent Sufis such as
Ali Hujwiri
refer to Ali as having a very high ranking in
Tasawwuf
. Furthermore,
Junayd of Baghdad
regarded Ali as
Sheikh
of the principals and practices of
Tasawwuf
.
[45]
Historian
Jonathan A.C. Brown
notes that during the lifetime of Muhammad, some companions were more inclined than others to "intensive devotion, pious abstemiousness and pondering the divine mysteries" more than Islam required, such as
Abu Dharr al-Ghifari
.
Hasan al-Basri
, a
tabi
', is considered a "founding figure" in the "science of purifying the heart".
[46]
Sufism emerged early on in
Islamic history
,
[6]
partly as a reaction against the worldliness of the early
Umayyad Caliphate
(661–750) and mainly under the tutelage of
Hasan al-Basri
.
[39]
Practitioners of Sufism hold that in its early stages of development Sufism effectively referred to nothing more than the internalization of Islam.
[47]
According to one perspective, it is directly from the Qur'an, constantly recited, meditated, and experienced, that Sufism proceeded, in its origin and its development.
[48]
Other practitioners have held that Sufism is the strict emulation of the way of Muhammad, through which the heart's connection to the Divine is strengthened.
[49]
Later developments of Sufism occurred from people like
Dawud Tai
and
Bayazid Bastami
.
[50]
Early on Sufism was known for its strict adherence to the
sunnah
, for example it was reported Bastami refused to eat a watermelon because he did not find any proof that Muhammad ever ate it.
[51]
[52]
According to the late medieval mystic, the Persian poet
Jami
,
[53]
Abd-Allah ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah
(died c. 716) was the first person to be called a "Sufi".
[33]
The term also had a strong connection with
Kufa
, with three of the earliest scholars to be called by the term being Abu Hashim al-Kufi,
[54]
Jabir ibn Hayyan
and Abdak al-Sufi.
[55]
Later individuals included Hatim al-Attar, from Basra, and
Al-Junayd al-Baghdadi
.
[55]
Others, such as
Al-Harith al-Muhasibi
and
Sari al-Saqati
, were not known as Sufis during their lifetimes, but later came to be identified as such due to their focus on
tazkiah
(purification).
[55]
Important contributions in writing are attributed to
Uwais al-Qarani
,
Hasan of Basra
,
Harith al-Muhasibi
,
Abu Nasr as-Sarraj
and
Said ibn al-Musayyib
.
[50]
Ruwaym
, from the second generation of Sufis in Baghdad, was also an influential early figure,
[56]
[57]
as was Junayd of Baghdad; a number of early practitioners of Sufism were disciples of one of the two.
[58]
Sufi orders
[
edit
]
Main articles:
Tariqa
and
List of Sufi orders
Historically, Sufis have often belonged to "orders" known as
tariqa
(pl.
ṭuruq
) – congregations formed around a grand master
wali
who will trace their teaching through a
chain of successive teachers
back to the
Islamic prophet
Muhammad
.
[7]
Within the Sufi tradition, the formation of the orders did not immediately produce lineages of master and disciple. There are few examples before the eleventh century of complete lineages going back to the Prophet Muhammad. Yet the symbolic importance of these lineages was immense: they provided a channel to divine authority through master-disciple chains. It was through such chains of masters and disciples that spiritual power and blessings were transmitted to both general and special devotees.
[59]
These orders meet for spiritual sessions (
majalis
) in meeting places known as
zawiyas
,
khanqahs
or
tekke
.
[60]
They strive for
ihsan
(perfection of worship), as detailed in a
hadith
: "Ihsan is to worship Allah as if you see Him; if you can't see Him, surely He sees you."
[61]
Sufis
regard Muhammad
as
al-Insān al-Kāmil
, the complete human who personifies the
attributes
of
Absolute Reality
,
[62]
and view him as their ultimate spiritual guide.
[63]
Sufi orders trace most of their original precepts from Muhammad through
Ali ibn Abi Talib
,
[64]
with the notable exception of the
Naqshbandi
order, who trace their original precepts to Muhammad through
Abu Bakr
.
[65]
However, it was not necessary to formally belong to a tariqa.
[66]
In the Medieval period, Sufism was almost equal to Islam in general and not limited to specific orders.
[67]
(p24)
Sufism had a long history already before the subsequent institutionalization of Sufi teachings into devotional orders (
tariqa
, pl.
tarîqât
) in the early Middle Ages.
[68]
The term
tariqa
is used for a school or order of Sufism, or especially for the mystical teaching and spiritual practices of such an order with the aim of seeking
ḥaqīqah
(ultimate truth). A tariqa has a
murshid
(guide) who plays the role of leader or spiritual director. The members or followers of a tariqa are known as
murīdīn
(singular
murīd
), meaning "desirous", viz. "desiring the knowledge of knowing God and loving God".
[69]
Over the years, Sufi orders have influenced and been adopted by various Shi'i movements, especially
Isma'ilism
, which led to the
Safaviyya
order's conversion to Shia Islam from Sunni Islam and the spread of
Twelverism
throughout Iran.
[70]

Sufism as an Islamic discipline
[
edit
]
Dancing dervishes, by
Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād
(c. 1480–1490)
Existing in both Sunni and Shia Islam, Sufism is not a distinct sect, as is sometimes erroneously assumed, but a method of approaching or a way of understanding the religion, which strives to take the regular practice of the religion to the "supererogatory level" through simultaneously "fulfilling ... [the obligatory] religious duties"
[6]
and finding a "way and a means of striking a root through the 'narrow gate' in the depth of the
soul
out into the domain of the pure arid unimprisonable
Spirit
which itself opens out on to the Divinity."
[25]
Academic studies of Sufism confirm that Sufism, as a separate tradition from Islam apart from so-called
pure Islam
, is frequently a product of
Western orientalism
and modern
Islamic fundamentalists
.
[71]
Al-Ghazali narrates in
Al-Munqidh min al-dalal
:
The vicissitudes of life, family affairs and financial constraints engulfed my life and deprived me of the congenial solitude. The heavy odds confronted me and provided me with few moments for my pursuits. This state of affairs lasted for ten years, but whenever I had some spare and congenial moments I resorted to my intrinsic proclivity. During these turbulent years, numerous astonishing and indescribable secrets of life were unveiled to me. I was convinced that the group of Aulia (holy mystics) is the only truthful group who follow the right path, display best conduct and surpass all sages in their wisdom and insight. They derive all their overt or covert behaviour from the illumining guidance of the holy Prophet, the only guidance worth quest and pursuit.
[72]
Formalization of doctrine
[

A Sufi in Ecstasy in a Landscape
.
Isfahan
,

(c. 1650–1660),
LACMA
.
In the eleventh-century, Sufism, which had previously been a less "codified" trend in Islamic piety, began to be "ordered and crystallized" into
orders
which have continued until the present day. All these orders were founded by a major Islamic scholar, and some of the largest and most widespread included the
Suhrawardiyya
(after
Abu al-Najib Suhrawardi
[d. 1168]),
Qadiriyya
(after
Abdul-Qadir Gilani
[d. 1166]), the
Rifa'iyya
(after
Ahmed al-Rifa'i
[d. 1182]), the
Chishtiyya
(after
Moinuddin Chishti
[d. 1236]), the
Shadiliyya
(after
Abul Hasan ash-Shadhili
[d. 1258]), the Hamadaniyyah (after
Sayyid Ali Hamadani
[d. 1384]), the Naqshbandiyya (after
Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari
[d. 1389]).
[73]
Contrary to popular perception in the West,
[74]
however, neither the founders of these orders nor their followers ever considered themselves to be anything other than orthodox Sunni Muslims,
[74]
and in fact all of these orders were attached to one of the
four orthodox legal schools
of Sunni Islam.
[75]
Thus, the
Qadiriyya
order was
Hanbali
, with its founder,
Abdul-Qadir Gilani
, being a renowned jurist; the
Chishtiyya
was
Hanafi
; the
Shadiliyya
order was
Maliki
; and the Naqshbandiyya order was
Hanafi
.
[76]
Thus, it is precisely because it is historically proven that "many of the most eminent defenders of Islamic orthodoxy, such as
Abdul-Qadir Gilani
,
Ghazali
, and the Sultan Ṣalāḥ ad-Dīn (
Saladin
) were connected with Sufism"
[77]

Historically, Sufism became "an incredibly important part of Islam" and "one of the most widespread and omnipresent aspects of Muslim life" in
Islamic civilization
from the early medieval period onwards,
[80]
[

when it began to permeate nearly all major aspects of Sunni Islamic life in regions stretching from India and Iraq to the
Balkans
and
Senegal

The rise of Islamic civilization coincides strongly with the spread of Sufi philosophy in Islam. The spread of Sufism has been considered a definitive factor in the spread of Islam, and in the creation of integrally Islamic cultures, especially in Africa
[82]
and Asia. The
Senussi
tribes of
Libya
and the
Sudan
are one of the strongest adherents of Sufism. Sufi poets and philosophers such as
Khoja Akhmet Yassawi
,
Rumi
, and
Attar of Nishapur
(c. 1145 – c. 1221) greatly enhanced the spread of Islamic culture in
Anatolia
,
Central Asia
, and
South Asia
.
[83]
[84]
Sufism also played a role in creating and propagating the culture of the
Ottoman
world,
[85]
and in resisting European imperialism in North Africa and South Asia.

Between the 13th and 16th centuries, Sufism produced a flourishing intellectual culture throughout the Islamic world, a "Renaissance" whose physical artifacts survive.

In many places a person or group would endow a
waqf
to maintain a lodge (known variously as a
zawiya
,
khanqah
, or
tekke
) to provide a gathering place for Sufi adepts, as well as lodging for itinerant seekers of knowledge. The same system of endowments could also pay for a complex of buildings, such as that surrounding the
Süleymaniye Mosque
in
Istanbul
, including a lodge for Sufi seekers, a
hospice
with kitchens where these seekers could serve the poor and/or complete a period of initiation, a library, and other structures. No important domain in the civilization of Islam remained unaffected by Sufism in this period.
[89]
Modern era
[
edit
]
Opposition to Sufi teachers and orders from more literalist and legalist strains of Islam existed in various forms throughout Islamic history. It took on a particularly violent form in the 18th century with the emergence of the
Wahhabi movement
.
[90]

Around the turn of the 20th century, Sufi rituals and doctrines also came under sustained criticism from
modernist Islamic reformers
, liberal nationalists, and, some decades later, socialist movements in the Muslim world. Sufi orders were accused of fostering popular superstitions, resisting modern intellectual attitudes, and standing in the way of progressive reforms. Ideological attacks on Sufism were reinforced by agrarian and educational reforms, as well as new forms of taxation, which were instituted by Westernizing national governments, undermining the economic foundations of Sufi orders. The extent to which Sufi orders declined in the first half of the 20th century varied from country to country, but by the middle of the century the very survival of the orders and traditional Sufi lifestyle appeared doubtful to many observers.
[91]
[90]
However, defying these predictions, Sufism and Sufi orders have continued to play a major role in the Muslim world, also expanding into Muslim-minority countries. Its ability to articulate an inclusive Islamic identity with greater emphasis on personal and small-group piety has made Sufism especially well-suited for contexts characterized by religious pluralism and secularist perspectives.
[90]
In the modern world, the classical interpretation of Sunni orthodoxy, which sees in Sufism an essential dimension of Islam alongside the disciplines of
jurisprudence
and
theology
, is represented by institutions such as
Egypt
's
Al-Azhar University
and
Zaytuna College
, with Al-Azhar's current
Grand Imam
Ahmed el-Tayeb
recently defining "Sunni orthodoxy" as being a follower "of any of the four schools of [legal] thought (
Hanafi
,
Shafi’i
,
Maliki
or
Hanbali
) and ... [also] of the Sufism of Imam
Junayd of Baghdad
in doctrines, manners and [spiritual] purification."

Turkey, Persia and The Indian Subcontinent have all been a center for many Sufi lineages and orders. The Bektashi were closely affiliated with the Ottoman
Janissaries
and are the heart of Turkey's large and mostly liberal
Alevi
population. They have spread westwards to
Cyprus
, Greece, Albania, Bulgaria, North Macedonia,
Bosnia and Herzegovina
,
Kosovo
, and, more recently, to the United States, via
Albania
. Sufism is popular in such African countries as Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Sudan, Morocco, and
Senegal
, where it is seen as a mystical expression of Islam.
[93]
Sufism is traditional in Morocco, but has seen a growing revival with the renewal of Sufism under contemporary spiritual teachers such as
Hamza al Qadiri al Boutchichi
. Mbacke suggests that one reason Sufism has taken hold in Senegal is because it can accommodate local beliefs and customs, which tend toward the
mystical
.
[94]
The life of the Algerian Sufi master
Abdelkader El Djezairi
is instructive in this regard.
[95]
Notable as well are the lives of
Amadou Bamba
and
El Hadj Umar Tall

Sheikh Mansur

[96]
A number of Westerners have embarked with varying degrees of success on the path of Sufism. One of the first to return to Europe as an official representative of a Sufi order, and with the specific purpose to spread Sufism in Western Europe, was the
Swedish
-born wandering Sufi
Ivan Aguéli
.
René Guénon
, the French scholar, became a Sufi in the early twentieth century and was known as Sheikh Abdul Wahid Yahya. His manifold writings defined the practice of Sufism as the essence of Islam, but also pointed to the universality of its message. Spiritualists, such as
George Gurdjieff
, may or may not conform to the tenets of Sufism as understood by orthodox Muslims.

The City of Saints

While all Muslims believe that they are on the pathway to Allah and hope to become close to God in
Paradise
—after death and after the
Last Judgment
—Sufis also believe that it is possible to draw closer to God and to more fully embrace the
divine presence
in this life.

The chief aim of all Sufis is to seek the pleasure of God by working to restore within themselves the primordial state of
fitra
.
[10]
To Sufis, the outer law consists of rules pertaining to worship, transactions, marriage, judicial rulings, and criminal law—what is often referred to, broadly, as "
qanun
". The inner law of Sufism consists of rules about repentance from sin, the purging of contemptible qualities and evil traits of character, and adornment with virtues and good character.
[98]
Teachings
[
edit
]
Man holding the hem of his beloved, an expression of a Sufi's agony of longing for the divine union
To the Sufi, it is the transmission of divine light from the teacher's heart to the heart of the student, rather than worldly knowledge, that allows the adept to progress. They further believe that the teacher should attempt inerrantly to follow the
Divine Law
.
[99]
According to
Moojan Momen
"one of the most important doctrines of Sufism is the concept of
al-Insan al-Kamil
("the Perfect Man"). This doctrine states that there will always exist upon the earth a "
Qutb
" (Pole or Axis of the Universe)—a man who is the perfect channel of grace from God to man and in a state of
wilayah
(sanctity, being under the protection of Allah). The concept of the Sufi Qutb is similar to that of the
Shi'i Imam
.
[100]
[101]
However, this belief puts Sufism in "direct conflict" with Shia Islam, since both the Qutb (who for most Sufi orders is the head of the order) and the Imam fulfill the role of "the purveyor of spiritual guidance and of
Allah
's grace to mankind". The vow of obedience to the Shaykh or Qutb which is taken by Sufis is considered incompatible with devotion to the Imam".
[100]
As a further example, the prospective adherent of the Mevlevi Order would have been ordered to serve in the kitchens of a hospice for the poor for 1001 days prior to being accepted for spiritual instruction, and a further 1,001 days in solitary retreat as a precondition of completing that instruction.
[102]
Some teachers, especially when addressing more general audiences, or mixed groups of Muslims and non-Muslims, make extensive use of
parable
,
allegory
, and
metaphor
.
[103]
Although approaches to teaching vary among different Sufi orders, Sufism as a whole is primarily concerned with direct personal experience, and as such has sometimes been compared to other, non-Islamic forms of
mysticism
(e.g., as in the books of
Seyyed Hossein Nasr
).
Many Sufi believe that to reach the highest levels of success in Sufism typically requires that the disciple live with and serve the teacher for a long period of time.
[104]
An example is the folk story about
Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari
, who gave his name to the Naqshbandi Order. He is believed to have served his first teacher,
Sayyid Muhammad Baba As-Samasi
, for 20 years, until as-Samasi died. He is said to then have served several other teachers for lengthy periods of time. He is said to have helped the poorer members of the community for many years, and after this concluded his teacher directed him to care for animals cleaning their wounds, and assisting them.

Muhammad
[

His [Muhammad's] aspiration preceded all other aspirations, his existence preceded nothingness, and his name preceded the Pen, because he existed before all peoples. There is not in the horizons, beyond the horizons or below the horizons, anyone more elegant, more noble, more knowing, more just, more fearsome, or more compassionate, than the subject of this tale. He is the leader of created beings, the one "whose name is glorious Ahmad".

Devotion to Muhammad is the strongest practice within Sufism.
[107]
Sufis have historically revered Muhammad as the prime personality of spiritual greatness. The Sufi poet
Saadi Shirazi
stated, "He who chooses a path contrary to that of the prophet shall never reach the destination. O Saadi, do not think that one can treat that way of purity except in the wake of the chosen one."
[108]
Rumi attributes his self-control and abstinence from worldly desires as qualities attained by him through the guidance of Muhammad. Rumi states, "I 'sewed' my two eyes shut from [desires for] this world and the next – this I learned from Muhammad."
[109]
Ibn Arabi
regards Muhammad as the greatest man and states, "Muhammad's wisdom is uniqueness (
fardiya
) because he is the most perfect existent creature of this human species. For this reason, the command began with him and was sealed with him. He was a Prophet while Adam was between water and clay, and his elemental structure is the Seal of the Prophets."
[110]
Attar of Nishapur
claimed that he praised Muhammad in such a manner that was not done before by any poet, in his book the
Ilahi-nama
.
[111]
Fariduddin Attar stated, "Muhammad is the exemplar to both worlds, the guide of the descendants of Adam. He is the sun of creation, the moon of the celestial spheres, the all-seeing eye...The seven heavens and the eight gardens of paradise were created for him; he is both the eye and the light in the light of our eyes."
[112]
Sufis have historically stressed the importance of Muhammad's perfection and his ability to intercede. The persona of Muhammad has historically been and remains an integral and critical aspect of Sufi belief and practice.
[107]
Bayazid Bastami is recorded to have been so devoted to the
sunnah
of Muhammad that he refused to eat a watermelon because he could not establish that Muhammad ever ate one.
[113]
In the 13th century, a Sufi poet from
Egypt
,
Al-Busiri
, wrote the
al-Kawākib ad-Durrīya fī Madḥ Khayr al-Barīya
('The Celestial Lights in Praise of the Best of Creation'), commonly referred to as
Qaṣīdat al-Burda
('Poem of the Mantle'), in which he extensively praised Muhammad.
[114]
This poem is still widely recited and sung amongst Sufi groups and lay Muslims alike all over the world.
[114]
Sufi beliefs about Muhammad
[
edit
]
According to Ibn Arabi, Islam is the best religion because of Muhammad.
[62]
Ibn Arabi
regards that the first entity that was brought into existence is the reality or essence of Muhammad (
al-ḥaqīqa al-Muhammadiyya
). Ibn Arabi regards Muhammad as the supreme human being and master of all creatures. Muhammad is therefore the primary
role model
for human beings to aspire to emulate.
[62]
Ibn Arabi believes that God's attributes and names are manifested in this world and that the most complete and perfect display of these divine attributes and names are seen in Muhammad.
[62]
Ibn Arabi believes that one may see God in the mirror of Muhammad, meaning that the divine attributes of God are manifested through Muhammad.
[62]
Ibn Arabi maintains that Muhammad is the best proof of God, and by knowing Muhammad one knows God.
[62]
Ibn Arabi also maintains that Muhammad is the master of all of humanity in both this world and the afterlife. In this view, Islam is the best religion because Muhammad is Islam.

Sufis believe the
sharia
(exoteric "canon"),
tariqa
("order") and
haqiqa
("truth") are mutually interdependent.
[115]
Sufism leads the adept, called
salik
or "wayfarer", in his
sulûk
or "road" through different stations (
maqāmāt
) until he reaches his goal, the perfect
tawhid
, the existential confession that God is One.
[116]
Ibn Arabi says, "When we see someone in this Community who claims to be able to guide others to God, but is remiss in but one rule of the Sacred Law—even if he manifests miracles that stagger the mind—asserting that his shortcoming is a special dispensation for him, we do not even turn to look at him, for such a person is not a sheikh, nor is he speaking the truth, for no one is entrusted with the secrets of God Most High save one in whom the ordinances of the Sacred Law are preserved. (
Jamiʿ karamat al-awliyaʾ
)".
[117]
[118]
It is related, moreover, that Malik, one of the founders of the four schools of Sunni law, was a strong proponent of combining the "inward science" ('
ilm al-bātin
) of mystical knowledge with the "outward science" of
jurisprudence
.
[119]
For example, the famous twelfth-century
Maliki
jurist and judge
Qadi Iyad
, later venerated as a
saint
throughout the
Iberian Peninsula
, narrated a tradition in which a man asked Malik "about something in the inward science", to which Malik replied: "Truly none knows the inward science except those who know the outward science! When he knows the outward science and puts it into practice, God shall open for him the inward science – and that will not take place except by the opening of his heart and its enlightenment." In other similar traditions, it is related that Malik said: "He who practices Sufism (
tasawwuf
) without learning Sacred Law corrupts his faith (
tazandaqa
), while he who learns Sacred Law without practicing Sufism corrupts himself (
tafassaqa
). Only he who combines the two proves true (
tahaqqaqa
)".
[119]
The
Amman Message
, a detailed statement issued by 200 leading Islamic scholars in 2005 in
Amman
, specifically recognized the validity of Sufism as a part of Islam. This was adopted by the Islamic world's political and temporal leaderships at the
Organisation of the Islamic Conference
summit at Mecca in December 2005, and by six other international Islamic scholarly assemblies including the International Islamic Fiqh Academy of Jeddah, in July 2006. The definition of Sufism can vary drastically between different traditions (what may be intended is simple
tazkiah
as opposed to the various manifestations of Sufism around the Islamic world).

The literature of Sufism emphasizes highly subjective matters that resist outside observation, such as the subtle states of the heart. Often these resist direct reference or description, with the consequence that the authors of various Sufi treatises took recourse to allegorical language. For instance, much Sufi poetry refers to intoxication, which Islam expressly forbids. This usage of indirect language and the existence of interpretations by people who had no training in Islam or Sufism led to doubts being cast over the validity of Sufism as a part of Islam. Also, some groups emerged that considered themselves above the
sharia
and discussed Sufism as a method of bypassing the rules of Islam in order to attain salvation directly. This was disapproved of by traditional scholars.
For these and other reasons, the relationship between traditional Islamic scholars and Sufism is complex, and a range of scholarly opinion on Sufism in Islam has been the norm. Some scholars, such as Al-Ghazali, helped its propagation while other scholars opposed it.
William Chittick
explains the position of Sufism and Sufis this way:
In short, Muslim scholars who focused their energies on understanding the normative guidelines for the body came to be known as jurists, and those who held that the most important task was to train the mind in achieving correct understanding came to be divided into three main schools of thought: theology, philosophy, and Sufism. This leaves us with the third domain of human existence, the spirit. Most Muslims who devoted their major efforts to developing the spiritual dimensions of the human person came to be known as Sufis.

Neo-Sufism
[
edit
]
The mausoleum (

) of
Ma Laichi
in
Linxia City
, China
The term
neo-Sufism
was originally coined by
Fazlur Rahman
and used by other scholars to describe reformist currents among 18th century Sufi orders, whose goal was to remove some of the more ecstatic and pantheistic elements of the Sufi tradition and reassert the importance of Islamic law as the basis for inner spirituality and social activism.
[17]
[15]
In recent times, it has been increasingly used by scholars like Mark Sedgwick in the opposite sense, to describe various forms of Sufi-influenced spirituality in the West, in particular the deconfessionalized spiritual movements which emphasize universal elements of the Sufi tradition and de-emphasize its Islamic context.
[15]
[16]
Devotional practices
[
edit
]
Sufi gathering engaged in
dhikr
The devotional practices of Sufis vary widely. Prerequisites to practice include rigorous adherence to Islamic norms (ritual prayer in its five prescribed times each day, the fast of Ramadan, and so forth). Additionally, the seeker ought to be firmly grounded in supererogatory practices known from the life of Muhammad (such as the "sunnah prayers"). This is in accordance with the words, attributed to God, of the following, a famous
Hadith Qudsi
:
My servant draws near to Me through nothing I love more than that which I have made obligatory for him. My servant never ceases drawing near to Me through supererogatory works until I love him. Then, when I love him, I am his hearing through which he hears, his sight through which he sees, his hand through which he grasps, and his foot through which he walks.
[123]
It is also necessary for the seeker to have a correct creed (
aqidah
),
[124]
and to embrace with certainty its tenets.
[125]
The seeker must also, of necessity, turn away from sins, love of this world, the love of company and renown, obedience to satanic impulse, and the promptings of the lower self. (The way in which this purification of the heart is achieved is outlined in certain books, but must be prescribed in detail by a Sufi master.) The seeker must also be trained to prevent the corruption of those good deeds which have accrued to his or her credit by overcoming the traps of ostentation, pride, arrogance, envy, and long hopes (meaning the hope for a long life allowing us to mend our ways later, rather than immediately, here and now).
Sufi practices, while attractive to some, are not a
means
for gaining knowledge. The traditional scholars of Sufism hold it as absolutely axiomatic that knowledge of God is not a psychological state generated through breath control. Thus, practice of "techniques" is not the cause, but instead the
occasion
for such knowledge to be obtained (if at all), given proper prerequisites and proper guidance by a master of the way. Furthermore, the emphasis on practices may obscure a far more important fact: The seeker is, in a sense, to become a broken person, stripped of all habits through the practice of (in the words of Imam Al-Ghazali) solitude, silence, sleeplessness, and hunger.
[126]
Dhikr
[
edit
]
Main article:
Dhikr
The name of Allah as written on the disciple's heart, according to the Sarwari Qadri Order
Dhikr
is the remembrance of Allah commanded in the
Quran
for all
Muslims
through a specific devotional act, such as the repetition of divine names, supplications and aphorisms from
hadith
literature and the Quran. More generally,
dhikr
takes a wide range and various layers of meaning.
[127]
This includes
dhikr
as any activity in which the Muslim maintains awareness of Allah. To engage in
dhikr
is to practice consciousness of the Divine Presence and
love
, or "to seek a state of godwariness". The Quran refers to Muhammad as the very embodiment of
dhikr
of Allah (65:10–11). Some types of
dhikr
are prescribed for all Muslims and do not require Sufi initiation or the prescription of a Sufi master because they are deemed to be good for every seeker under every circumstance.
[128]
The
dhikr
may slightly vary among each order. Some Sufi orders
[129]
engage in ritualized
dhikr
ceremonies, or
sema
.
Sema
includes various forms of worship such as
recitation
,
singing
(the most well known being the
Qawwali
music of the Indian subcontinent),
instrumental music
,
dance
(most famously the
Sufi whirling
of the
Mevlevi order
),
incense
,
meditation
,
ecstasy
, and
trance
.
[130]
Some Sufi orders stress and place extensive reliance upon
dhikr
. This practice of
dhikr
is called
Dhikr-e-Qulb
(invocation of Allah within the heartbeats). The basic idea in this practice is to visualize the Allah as having been written on the disciple's heart.

The practice of
muraqaba
can be likened to the practices of
meditation
attested in many faith communities.
[132]
While variation exists, one description of the practice within a Naqshbandi lineage reads as follows:
He is to collect all of his bodily senses in concentration, and to cut himself off from all preoccupation and notions that inflict themselves upon the heart. And thus he is to turn his full consciousness towards God Most High while saying three times: "
Ilahî anta maqsûdî wa-ridâka matlûbî
—my God, you are my Goal and Your good pleasure is what I seek". Then he brings to his heart the Name of the Essence—Allâh—and as it courses through his heart he remains attentive to its meaning, which is "Essence without likeness". The seeker remains aware that He is Present, Watchful, Encompassing of all, thereby exemplifying the meaning of his saying (may God bless him and grant him peace): "Worship God as though you see Him, for if you do not see Him, He sees you". And likewise the prophetic tradition: "The most favored level of faith is to know that God is witness over you, wherever you may be".

Sufi whirling
[

Main article:
Sufi whirling
Whirling Dervishes
, at Rumi Fest 2007
Sufi whirling (or Sufi spinning) is a form of
Sama
or physically active
meditation
which originated among some Sufis, and practised by the Sufi
Dervishes
of the
Mevlevi order
. It is a customary dance performed within the
sema
, through which dervishes (also called
semazens
, from
Persian
سماعزن
) aim to reach the source of all perfection, or
kemal
. This is sought through abandoning one's
nafs
,
egos
or personal desires, by listening to the music, focusing on
God
, and spinning one's body in repetitive circles, which has been seen as a symbolic imitation of planets in the
Solar System
orbiting the Sun.
[134]
As explained by Mevlevi practitioners:
[135]
In the symbolism of the Sema ritual, the semazen's camel's hair hat (sikke) represents the tombstone of the ego; his wide, white skirt (
tennure
) represents the ego's shroud. By removing his black cloak (
hırka
), he is spiritually reborn to the truth. At the beginning of the Sema, by holding his arms crosswise, the semazen appears to represent the number one, thus testifying to God's unity. While whirling, his arms are open: his right arm is directed to the sky, ready to receive God's beneficence; his left hand, upon which his eyes are fastened, is turned toward the earth. The semazen conveys God's spiritual gift to those who are witnessing the Sema. Revolving from right to left around the heart, the semazen embraces all humanity with love. The human being has been created with love in order to love. Mevlâna Jalâluddîn Rumi says, "All loves are a bridge to Divine love. Yet, those who have not had a taste of it do not know!"
The traditional view of most orthodox Sunni Sufi orders, such as the
Qadiriyya
and the
Chisti
, as well as
Sunni Muslim
scholars in general, is that dancing with intent during dhikr or whilst listening to
Sema
is prohibited.

Singing
[

]
Kurdish Dervishes practice Sufism with playing
Daf
in
Sulaymaniyah
,
Iraqi Kurdistan
.
Musical instruments (except the
Daf
) have traditionally been considered as prohibited by the four orthodox Sunni schools,
[136]
[140]
[141]
[142]
[143]
and the more orthodox Sufi tariqas also continued to prohibit their use. Throughout history most Sufi saints have stressed that musical instruments are forbidden.
[136]
[144]
[145]
However some Sufi Saints permitted and encouraged it, whilst maintaining that musical instruments and female voices should not be introduced, although these are common practice today.
[136]
[144]
For example
Qawwali
was originally a form of Sufi devotional singing popular in the
Indian subcontinent
, and is now usually performed at
dargahs
. Sufi saint
Amir Khusrau
is said to have infused Persian, Arabic Turkish and
Indian classical
melodic styles to create the genre in the 13th century. The songs are classified into
hamd
,
na'at
,
manqabat
,
marsiya
or
ghazal
, among others.
Nowadays, the songs last for about 15 to 30 minutes, are performed by a group of singers, and instruments including the
harmonium
,
tabla
and
dholak
are used. Pakistani singing maestro
Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan
is credited with popularizing

Main article:
Wali
Walī
(
Arabic
:
ولي
, plural
ʾawliyāʾ
أولياء
) is an Arabic word whose literal meanings include "custodian", "protector", "helper", and "friend".
[147]
In the vernacular, it is most commonly used by Muslims to indicate an Islamic
saint
, otherwise referred to by the more literal "friend of God".
[148]
[149]
[150]
In the traditional Islamic understanding of
saints
, the saint is portrayed as someone "marked by [special] divine favor ... [and] holiness", and who is specifically "chosen by God and endowed with exceptional gifts, such as the ability to work
miracles
."
[151]
The doctrine of saints was articulated by Islamic scholars very early on in Muslim history,
[152]
[153]
[6]
[154]
and particular verses of the
Quran
and certain
hadith
were interpreted by early Muslim thinkers as "documentary evidence"
[6]
of the existence of saints.
Since the first Muslim hagiographies were written during the period when Sufism began its rapid expansion, many of the figures who later came to be regarded as the major saints in Sunni Islam were the early Sufi mystics, like
Hasan of Basra
(d. 728),
Farqad Sabakhi
(d. 729),
Dawud Tai
(d. 777-81)
Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya
(d. 801),
Maruf Karkhi
(d. 815), and
Junayd of Baghdad (d. 910)
. From the twelfth to the fourteenth century, "the general veneration of saints, among both people and sovereigns, reached its definitive form with the organization of Sufism ... into orders or brotherhoods."
[155]
In the common expressions of Islamic piety of this period, the saint was understood to be "a contemplative whose state of spiritual perfection ... [found] permanent expression in the teaching bequeathed to his disciples."
[155]
Visitation
[

In popular Sufism (i.e. devotional practices that have achieved currency in world cultures through Sufi influence), one common practice is to
visit or make pilgrimages
to the tombs of saints, renowned scholars, and righteous people. This is a particularly common practice in South Asia, where famous tombs include such saints as
Sayyid Ali Hamadani
in
Kulob
, Tajikistan;
Afāq Khoja
, near
Kashgar
, China;
Lal Shahbaz Qalandar
in
Sindh
;
Ali Hujwari
in
Lahore
, Pakistan;
Bahauddin Zakariya
in
Multan
Pakistan;
Moinuddin Chishti
in
Ajmer
, India;
Nizamuddin Auliya
in
Delhi
, India; and
Shah Jalal
in
Sylhet
, Bangladesh.
Likewise, in
Fez
, Morocco, a popular destination for such pious visitation is the
Zaouia Moulay Idriss II
and the yearly visitation to see the current Sheikh of the Qadiri Boutchichi
Tariqah
, Sheikh Sidi Hamza al Qadiri al Boutchichi to celebrate the
Mawlid
(which is usually televised on Moroccan National television).
[156]
[157]
This action has voiced particular condemnation by the Salafis.

Main article:
Karamat
In Islamic mysticism,
karamat
(
Arabic
:
کرامات
karāmāt
, pl. of
کرامة
karāmah
, lit. generosity, high-mindedness
[158]
) refers to supernatural wonders performed by
Muslim saints
. In the technical vocabulary of Islamic religious sciences, the singular form
karama
has a sense similar to
charism
, a favor or spiritual gift freely bestowed by God.
[159]
The marvels ascribed to Islamic saints have included supernatural physical actions, predictions of the future, and "interpretation of the secrets of hearts".
[159]
Historically, a "belief in the miracles of saints (
karāmāt al-awliyāʾ
, literally 'marvels of the friends [of God]')" has been "a requirement in Sunni Islam".
[160]
Shrines
[
edit
]
A
dargah
(
Persian
: درگاه
dargâh
or درگه
dargah
, also in
Punjabi
and
Urdu
) is a
shrine
built over the grave of a revered religious figure, often a Sufi
saint
or
dervish
. Sufis often visit the shrine for
ziyarat
, a term associated with religious visits and pilgrimages.
Dargah
s are often associated with Sufi eating and meeting rooms and hostels, called
khanqah
or hospices. They usually include a mosque, meeting rooms, Islamic religious schools (
madrassas
), residences for a teacher or caretaker, hospitals, and other buildings for community purposes.
Theoretical perspectives
[
edit
]
The works of Al-Ghazali firmly defended the concepts of Sufism within the Islamic faith.
Traditional Islamic scholars have recognized two major branches within the practice of Sufism and use this as one key to differentiating among the approaches of different masters and devotional lineages.
[161]
On the one hand there is the order from the signs to the Signifier (or from the arts to the Artisan). In this branch, the seeker begins by purifying the lower self of every corrupting influence that stands in the way of recognizing all of creation as the work of God, as God's active self-disclosure or
theophany
.
[162]
This is the way of Imam Al-Ghazali and of the majority of the Sufi orders.
On the other hand, there is the order from the Signifier to his signs, from the Artisan to his works. In this branch the seeker experiences divine attraction (
jadhba
), and is able to enter the order with a glimpse of its endpoint, of direct apprehension of the Divine Presence towards which all spiritual striving is directed. This does not replace the striving to purify the heart, as in the other branch; it simply stems from a different point of entry into the path. This is the way primarily of the masters of the Naqshbandi and
Shadhili
orders.
[163]
Contemporary scholars may also recognize a third branch, attributed to the late
Ottoman
scholar
Said Nursi
and explicated in his vast Qur'an commentary called the
Risale-i Nur
. This approach entails strict adherence to the way of Muhammad, in the understanding that this wont, or
sunnah
, proposes a complete devotional spirituality adequate to those without access to a master of the Sufi way.
[164]
Contributions to other domains of scholarship
[
edit
]
Sufism has contributed significantly to the elaboration of theoretical perspectives in many domains of intellectual endeavor. For instance, the doctrine of "subtle centers" or centers of subtle cognition (known as
Lataif-e-sitta
) addresses the matter of the awakening of spiritual intuition.
[165]
In general, these subtle centers or
latâ'if
are thought of as faculties that are to be purified sequentially in order to bring the seeker's wayfaring to completion. A concise and useful summary of this system from a living exponent of this tradition has been published by
Muhammad Emin Er
.
[161]
Sufi psychology
has influenced many areas of thinking both within and outside of Islam, drawing primarily upon three concepts.
Ja'far al-Sadiq
(both an
imam
in the
Shia
tradition and a respected scholar and link in chains of Sufi transmission in all Islamic sects) held that human beings are dominated by a lower self called the
nafs
(self, ego, person), a faculty of spiritual intuition called the
qalb
(heart), and
ruh
(soul). These interact in various ways, producing the spiritual types of the tyrant (dominated by
nafs
), the person of faith and moderation (dominated by the spiritual heart), and the person lost in love for God (dominated by the
ruh
).
[166]
Of note with regard to the spread of Sufi psychology in the West is
Robert Frager
, a Sufi teacher authorized in the
Khalwati
Jerrahi
order. Frager was a trained psychologist, born in the United States, who converted to Islam in the course of his practice of Sufism and wrote extensively on Sufism and psychology.

Sufi cosmology
and

[168]
Other concepts
[
edit
]
Kashf
(unveiling)
: It is a light that comes to those who walk in their journey to God. He reveals to them the veil of sense, and removes from them the causes of matter as a result of the striving, seclusion and remembrance they take themselves with.
At-Takhalli, At-Tahalli, At-
Tajalli
:  At-Takhalli
means emptying and purification of the aspirant, both internally and externally, from bad morals, reprehensible behavior, and destructive deeds.
At-Tahlili
means adorning the aspirant, both internally and externally, with virtuous morals, good behavior, and good deeds.
At-Tajalli
means having spiritual experiences that strengthen the faith.
Hal
and
maqam
:
Hal
is temporary state of
consciousness
, generally understood to be the product of a
Sufi's
spiritual practices while on his way toward God.
Maqam
refers to each stage a
Sufi
's soul must attain in its search for Allah.
Farasa
(physiognomy)
: which is concerned with knowing the thoughts and conversations of souls. In the hadith: (Fear the insight of the believer, for he sees with the light of God), and it depends on his strength. Proximity and knowledge. The stronger the closeness and the more knowledgeable the knowledge becomes, the more accurate the insight becomes, because if the soul is close to the presence of the truth, nothing but the truth often appears in it.
Ilham
(
inspiration
): This is what is received in awe through abundance. It was said: Inspiration is the knowledge that falls into the heart.
Marifa
(knowing God and knowing oneself):
In the hadith (Whoever knows himself knows his Lord), the Sufis said: Whoever knows himself with imperfection, need, and servitude, knows his Lord with perfection, richness, and divinity, but few people know themselves in this sense and see it as it really is, so most people dispute divinity and object to destiny and do not They are satisfied with God's ruling, their trust is diminished, and they rely with their hearts on the reasons, for they are their scene and the subject of their consideration, and their view is not that God Almighty is the one who disposes, gives, and prevents.. Most people live as captives of their souls.
The Seven stages of nafs
: There are three basic stages of the soul, as Sufi wisdom states, as well as various verses from the Qur’an. Sufism calls them “stages” in continuous processes of development and refinement. In addition to the three main stages, four additional stages are mentioned.
Lataif-e-Sitta
: The Six Latifs in Sufism are psychological or spiritual “organs” and, sometimes, perceptual and extrasensory tools in
Sufi psychology
, and are explained here according to their use among particular Sufi groups. These six subtleties are believed to be part of the self in a similar way to the way glands and organs are part of the body.
The Educating
Sheikh
: In Sufism there must be a spiritual influence, which comes through the Sheikh who took the method from his Sheikh until the chain of reception reaches in a continuous chain of transmission from the Sheikh to the Messenger Muhammad. They say: He who has no sheikh, his sheikh is Satan.
Pledge of Allegiance
: The disciple pledges allegiance to the guide, and pledges to walk with him on the path of abandoning faults, displaying good qualities, achieving the pillar of benevolence, and advancing in his stations. It is like a promise and covenant.
Jihad
al nafs/
tazkiyah
: Sufism says: abandonment, then adornment, then manifestation, abandonment of reprehensible morals, and liberation from the shackles of the dark forces in the soul of lust, anger, and envy, the morals of animals, wild beasts, and demons. Then have good morals, and enlighten the heart and soul with the light of our Master, the Messenger of God and his family, then the lights of God will be revealed to the eyes of the heart after erasing the veils that were blocking the heart from viewing and enjoying them. This is the highest bliss for the people of Paradise. With it, God honors the elite of His beloved servants in this abode, each according to his luck and share from the Messenger of God.
Barakah
: It is seeking blessing from God through legitimate reasons, the greatest of which is begging Him for that by which one has been blessed, whether it is a person, an effect, or a place. This blessing, as they believe, is sought by being exposed to it in its proper place by turning to God and supplicating to Him. They cite as evidence the many stories of the Companions’ blessings of the Prophet Muhammad.

Ibn 'Arabi
(or Ibn al-'Arabi) (AH 561 – AH 638; July 28, 1165 – November 10, 1240) is considered to be one of the most important Sufi masters, although he never founded any order (
tariqa
). His writings, especially
al-Futuhat al-Makkiyya
and Fusus al-Hikam, have been studied within all the Sufi orders as the clearest expression of
tawhid
(Divine Unity), though because of their recondite nature they were often only given to initiates. Later those who followed his teaching became known as the school of
wahdat al-wujud
(the Oneness of Being). He himself considered his writings to have been divinely inspired. As he expressed the Way to one of his close disciples, his legacy is that 'you should never ever abandon your servant-hood (
ʿubudiyya
), and that there may never be in your soul a longing for any existing thing'.
[191]
Junayd of Baghdad
[
edit
]
Junayd al-Baghdadi
(830–910) was one of the great early Sufis. His practice of Sufism was considered dry and sober unlike some of the more ecstatic behaviours of other Sufis during his life. His order was the Junaydiyya, which links to the golden chain of many Sufi orders. He laid the groundwork for sober mysticism in contrast to that of God-intoxicated Sufis like al-Hallaj, Bayazid Bastami and Abusaeid Abolkheir. During the trial of al-Hallaj, his former disciple, the Caliph of the time demanded his fatwa. In response, he issued this fatwa: "From the outward appearance he is to die and we judge according to the outward appearance and God knows better". He is referred to by Sufis as Sayyid-ut Taifa—i.e., the leader of the group. He lived and died in the city of Baghdad.
Mansur Al-Hallaj
[
edit
]
Mansur Al-Hallaj
(died 922) is renowned for his claim,
Ana-l-Haqq
("I am The Truth"), his ecstatic Sufism and state trial. His refusal to recant this utterance, which was regarded as
apostasy
, led to a long trial. He was imprisoned for 11 years in a Baghdad prison, before being tortured and publicly beheaded on March 26, 922. He is still revered by Sufis for his willingness to embrace torture and death rather than recant. It is said that during his prayers, he would say "O Lord! You are the guide of those who are passing through the Valley of Bewilderment. If I am a heretic, enlarge my heresy".

A Mughal-era Sufi prayer book from the
Chishti order
Moinuddin Chishti
was born in 1141 and died in 1236. Also known as
Gharīb Nawāz
("Benefactor of the Poor"), he is the most famous Sufi saint of the Chishti Order. Moinuddin Chishti introduced and established the order in the Indian subcontinent. The initial spiritual chain or silsila of the Chishti order in India, comprising Moinuddin Chishti,
Bakhtiyar Kaki
,
Baba Farid
,
Nizamuddin Auliya
(each successive person being the disciple of the previous one), constitutes the great Sufi saints of Indian history. Moinuddin Chishtī turned towards India, reputedly after a dream in which Muhammad blessed him to do so. After a brief stay at Lahore, he reached
Ajmer
along with Sultan
Shahāb-ud-Din Muhammad Ghori
, and settled down there. In Ajmer, he attracted a substantial following, acquiring a great deal of respect amongst the residents of the city. Moinuddin Chishtī practiced the Sufi
Sulh-e-Kul
(peace to all) concept to promote understanding between Muslims and non-Muslims.

from a
Persian
dictionary
Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya or
Rabia of Basra
(died 801) was a mystic who represents countercultural elements of Sufism, especially with regards to the status and power of women. Prominent Sufi leader
Hasan of Basra
is said to have castigated himself before her superior merits and sincere virtues.
[196]
Rabi'a was born of very poor origin, but was captured by bandits at a later age and sold into slavery. She was however released by her master when he awoke one night to see the light of sanctity shining above her head.
[197]
Rabi'a al-Adawiyya is known for her teachings and emphasis on the centrality of the love of God to a holy life.
[198]
She is said to have proclaimed, running down the streets of
Basra
, Iraq:
O God! If I worship You for fear of Hell, burn me in Hell, and if I worship You in hope of Paradise, exclude me from Paradise. But if I worship You for Your Own sake, grudge me not Your everlasting Beauty.

Rabi'a al-Adawiyya
There are different opinions about  the
death
and resting place of Bibi Rabia. Some believe her resting place to be
Jerusalem
whereas others believe it to be
Basra

(

which resulted in the deaths of 90 people.
[224]
[225]
[226]
The persecution of Sufism and Sufi Muslims over the course of centuries has included acts of
religious discrimination
,
persecution
and
violence
, such as the destruction of Sufi shrines, tombs, and mosques, suppression of Sufi orders, and discrimination against adherents of Sufism in a number of
Muslim-majority countries
.
[2]
The
Republic of Turkey
banned all Sufi orders and abolished their institutions in 1925, after Sufis opposed the new secular order. The
Islamic Republic of Iran
has harassed Shia Sufis, reportedly for their lack of support for the government doctrine of "
governance of the jurist
" (i.e., that the supreme
Shiite
jurist
should be the nation's political leader).
In most other Muslim-majority countries, attacks on Sufis and especially their shrines have come from adherents of
puritanical
and
revivalist
Islamic movements
(
Salafis
and
Wahhabis
), who believe that practices such as
visitation to
and
veneration of the tombs
of
Sufi saints
,
celebration of the birthdays of Sufi saints
, and
dhikr
("remembrance" of
God
) ceremonies are
bid‘ah
(impure "innovation") and
shirk
("polytheistic").

Perception outside Islam
[
edit
]
A choreographed Sufi performance on a Friday in Sudan
Sufi mysticism has long exercised a fascination upon the Western world, and especially its Orientalist scholars.
[232]
In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, European orientalists treated Sufism and Islam as distinct subjects, leading to "an over-emphasis on the translation of classical Sufi mystical literature" in the academic study of Sufism at the expense of the lived practises in Islam, as well as a separation of Sufism from its Islamic roots in the development of Sufism as a religious form in the West.
[233]
[234]
Figures like Rumi have become well known in the United States, where Sufism is perceived as a peaceful and apolitical form of Islam.
[232]
[235]
Seyyed Hossein Nasr
states that the preceding theories are false according to the point of view of Sufism.
[236]
The contemporary amateur historian David Livingstone writes:
"Sufi practices are merely attempts to attain psychic states—for their own sake—though it is claimed the pursuit represents seeking closeness to God, and that the achieved magical powers are gifts of advanced spirituality. For several reasons, Sufism was generally looked upon as heretical among Muslim scholars. Among the deviations introduced by the Sufis was the tendency to believe the daily prayers to be only for the masses who had not achieved deeper spiritual knowledge, but could be disregarded by those more advanced spiritually. The Sufis introduced the practice of congregational Dhikr, or religious oral exercises, consisting of a continuous repetition of the name of God. These practices were unknown to early Islam, and consequently regarded as Bid'ah, meaning "unfounded innovation". Also, many of the Sufis adopted the practice of total Tawakkul, or complete "trust" or "dependence" on God, by avoiding all kinds of labor or commerce, refusing medical care when they were ill, and living by begging."
[237]

Museum Library
The Islamic Institute in Mannheim, Germany, which works towards the integration of Europe and Muslims, sees Sufism as particularly suited for interreligious dialogue and intercultural harmonisation in democratic and pluralist societies; it has described Sufism as a symbol of tolerance and
humanism
—nondogmatic, flexible and non-violent.
[238]
According to
Philip Jenkins
, a professor at
Baylor University
, "the Sufis are much more than tactical allies for the West: they are, potentially, the greatest hope for pluralism and democracy within Muslim nations." Likewise, several governments and organisations have advocated the promotion of Sufism as a means of combating intolerant and
violent strains of Islam
.
[239]
For example, the Chinese and Russian
[240]
governments openly favor Sufism as the best means of protecting against Islamist subversion. The British government, especially following the
7 July 2005 London bombings
, has favoured Sufi groups in its battle against
Muslim extremist
currents. The influential
RAND Corporation
, an American think-tank, issued a major report titled "Building Moderate Muslim Networks", which urged the US government to form links with and bolster
[241]
Muslim groups that opposed Islamist extremism. The report stressed the Sufi role as moderate traditionalists open to change, and thus as allies against violence.
[242]
[243]
News organisations such as the BBC, Economist and Boston Globe have also seen Sufism as a means to deal with violent Muslim extremists.
[244]
Idries Shah
states that Sufism is universal in nature, its roots predating the rise of Islam and Christianity.
[245]
He quotes
Suhrawardi
as saying that "this (Sufism) was a form of wisdom known to and practiced by a succession of sages including the mysterious ancient
Hermes of Egypt
.", and that
Ibn al-Farid
"stresses that Sufism lies behind and before systematization; that 'our wine existed before what you call the grape and the vine' (the school and the system)..."
[246]
Shah's views have however been rejected by modern scholars.
[11]
Such modern trends of neo-Sufis in Western countries allow non-Muslims to receive "instructions on following the Sufi path", not without opposition by Muslims who consider such instruction outside the sphere of Islam.
[247]
Similarities with Eastern religions
[
edit

See also:
Hindu-Islamic relations § Sufism
Numerous comparisons have been made between Sufism and the mystic components of some
Eastern religions
.
The tenth-century Persian polymath
Al-Biruni
in his book
Tahaqeeq Ma Lilhind Min Makulat Makulat Fi Aliaqbal Am Marzula
(Critical Study of Indian Speech: Rationally Acceptable or Rejected) discusses the similarity of some Sufism concepts with aspects of Hinduism, such as: Atma with ruh, tanasukh with reincarnation, Mokhsha with Fanafillah, Ittihad with Nirvana: union  between Paramatma in Jivatma, Avatar or Incarnation with Hulul, Vedanta with Wahdatul Ujud, Mujahadah with Sadhana.

[249]
Muraqaba
to

[250]
The ninth-century Iranian mystic
Bayazid Bostami
is alleged to have imported certain concepts from Hindusim into his version of Sufism under the conceptual umbrella of
baqaa
, meaning perfection.
[251]
Ibn al-Arabi
and
Mansur al-Hallaj
both referred to Muhammad as having attained perfection and titled him as
Al-Insān al-Kāmil
.

Inayat Khan believed that the God worshipped by Sufis is not specific to any particular religion or creed, but is the same God worshipped by people of all beliefs. This God is not limited by any name, whether it be Allah, God, Gott, Dieu, Khuda, Brahma, or Bhagwan.

Jewish philosophy
There is evidence that Sufism influenced the development of some schools of Jewish philosophy and ethics. In the first writing of this kind, we see
Kitab al-Hidayah ila Fara'iḍ al-Ḳulub
,
Duties of the Heart
, of
Bahya ibn Paquda
. This book was translated by
Judah ibn Tibbon
into
Hebrew
under the title
Chovot HaLevavot
.
[259]
The precepts prescribed by the
Torah
number 613 only; those dictated by the intellect are innumerable.
—
Kremer, Alfred Von. 1868. "Notice sur Sha‘rani".
Journal Asiatique
11 (6): 258.
In the ethical writings of the Sufis
Al-Kusajri
and
Al-Harawi
there are sections which treat of the same subjects as those treated in the
Chovot ha-Lebabot
and which bear the same titles: e.g., "Bab al-Tawakkul"; "Bab al-Taubah"; "Bab al-Muḥasabah"; "Bab al-Tawaḍu'"; "Bab al-Zuhd". In the ninth gate, Baḥya directly quotes sayings of the Sufis, whom he calls
Perushim
. However, the author of the
Chovot HaLevavot
did not go so far as to approve of the asceticism of the Sufis, although he showed a marked predilection for their ethical principles.
Abraham Maimonides
, the son of the Jewish philosopher
Maimonides
, believed that Sufi practices and doctrines continue the tradition of the biblical prophets.
[260]
Abraham Maimonides' principal work was originally composed in
Judeo-Arabic
and entitled "כתאב כפאיה אלעאבדין"
Kitāb Kifāyah al-'Ābidīn
(
A Comprehensive Guide for the Servants of God
). From the extant surviving portion it is conjectured that the treatise was three times as long as his father's
Guide for the Perplexed
. In the book, he evidences a great appreciation for, and affinity to, Sufism. Followers of his path continued to foster a Jewish-Sufi form of pietism for at least a century, and he is rightly considered the founder of this pietistic school, which was centered in
Egypt
.
[261]
The followers of this path, which they called
Hasidism
(not to be confused with the [later]
Jewish
Hasidic
movement) or Sufism (
Tasawwuf
), practiced spiritual retreats, solitude, fasting and sleep deprivation. The Jewish Sufis maintained their own
brotherhood
, guided by a religious leader like a Sufi
sheikh
.
[262]
The Jewish Encyclopedia
, in its entry on Sufism, states that the revival of Jewish mysticism in Muslim countries is probably due to the spread of Sufism in the same geographical areas. The entry details many parallels to Sufic concepts found in the writings of prominent
Kabbalists
during the
Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain
.

Sama
[
edit

Sama
is regarded as an important element of different Sufi orders. In South Asia, it is affiliated mostly with Chisti Sufism. It develops into a distinct art form, especially during the reign of Khawja Amir Khusro and his contemporary Sufi masters, such as Khwaja Nizamuddin au'iya and others.
[268]
Spiritual experiences were desired by Sufis through Sama, listening to poetry or Islamic mystical verses with the use of different musical instruments, aiming to stir an intense desire for the divine beloved in the heart of the listener.

Visual art

Islamic art
Many painters and visual artists have explored the Sufi motif through various disciplines. One of the outstanding pieces in the
Brooklyn Museum's Islamic gallery
has been the museum's associate curator of Islamic art, is a large 19th- or early-20th-century portrayal of the
Battle of Karbala
painted by Abbas Al-Musavi,
[270]
which was a violent episode in the disagreement between the Sunni and Shia branches of Islam; during this battle,
Husayn ibn Ali
, a pious grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, died and is considered a
martyr
in Islam.
[271]
In July 2016, at International Sufi Festival held in Noida Film City, UP, India, H.E. Abdul Basit who was the High Commissioner of Pakistan to India at that time, while inaugurating the exhibition of Farkhananda Khan ‘Fida’ said, "There is no barrier of words or explanation about the paintings or rather there is a soothing message of brotherhood, peace in Sufism".

However, later on this Simaa' was modernized to include dancing and music, thus giving rise to the concept of "whirling dervishes". This is a Bid'ah and is not the creation of orthodox Sufism.

"Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, European orientalists would develop the thesis that Sufism and Islam were separate religious phenomena. The effect on Sufism in the West was twofold. The first impacted on the academic study of Sufism and the second on the development of Sufism as a religious form in Europe and North America. The separation of Sufism from its Islamic roots led to an over-emphasis on the translation of classical Sufi mystical literature at the expense of the lived religion practised throughout the Muslim world and perceived as part and parcel of a normative Islamic worldview, even if deeply contested in the Muslim majority world."
