On February 1st, the USO opened on Ft. Moore, where soldiers come to "Be Moore." Renamed in May 2023 to honor Lt. Gen. Hal Moore and Julia Moore; for Lt. Gen. Moore's heroic feats in combat in Vietnam, and his wife Julia, for single handedly changing the Pentagon's death notification policy to make sure a human being accompanied the casualty notification to comfort the wife and family.  The Ft. Moore USO is a premier center to serve a premier Army base. Before cutting the ribbon we spent a day with the U.S. Army Infantry soldiers-in-training conducting rappelling and rope traversing.  Needless to say, they were happy to see a few friendly civilians after weeks of confronting their fears to become our next generation of peace keepers.

John Riggins:  I am so saddened by the passing of the Supreme Court‚Äôs First Lady. Back in ‚Äô85 our chance meeting at the White House Correspondents Dinner became an international event. And, over the years our paths would occasionally cross, which usually led to a memorable occasion. One that I recall was at the Olney Theater, where after my performance, she came up on stage and presented me with a dozen roses, and I autographed a football for her. Another was at the Alfalfa Club in the Washington Hilton about ten years or so ago. She was the out going President of the club, and during her farewell speech she told the audience she had something to say that she‚Äôd been wanting to say for years. She then uttered, ‚ÄúLoosen up Johnny, baby!‚Äù, and she brought the house down.

Here‚Äôs to you Sandy, baby, you‚Äôll always be the greatest!

Salute to Service Day went around the NFL this month.  I met my husband when he sent my Ranger father a glass of champagne, with the message, "a veteran or service member never pays for a drink."  Thank you
Washington Commanders
for giving the
USO
the game ball at your Salute to Service game and for being the only franchise to host all military every home game, in the pre-game, rowdy USO tent.  The military and the NFL, it's a love affair.

To the men in my family on Veteran's Day, who have served or continue to serve. You and the long line of men and women standing with you, inspire my work every day.

Thank you Col. Greg "Tackleberry" Curtis, Commanding Officer of Headquarters and Service Battalion, Parris Island, and SgtMaj
Frank Robinson
, his Sergeant Major, for hosting me, and providing a world-class tour of the Island, where America "makes Marines!"  The double entendre was not lost on me.  There are no boulangeries, street corner cafes and high fashion on "Parris Island." Resources are scarce on this training base for 20,000+ Marine Recruits each year.  Col. Curtis and SgtMaj Robinson are morale-driven leaders, hoping to bring some USO escape to the remarkable sons and daughters who say yes to our nation's call for peace keepers.

The
USO
is now on Camp LeJeune!  We opened our first USO in 2019 on Marine Corps Base Camp Pendelton, and two more in 2021 and 2022 on Marine Corps Base Quantico.  On Sept 14th, 2023, we completed a trifecta with the opening of a 8,800 sq. ft. USO center on Marine Corps Base Camp LeJeune. Thank you LtGen David Ottington, Commanding General, 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force and Col Adolfo Garcia, Jr., Commander Marine Corps Installations East, Camp LeJeune, for showing your support and allowing our staff the privilege of creating a home away from home for your Marines, Sailors and their families.  Oorah!
United States Marine Corps

At 101 years old, Lt. Gen. James "Don" Hughes came out to Military Appreciation Day at the Washington Football team training camp in Ashburn, VA. yesterday.  General Hughes is a West Point graduate class of 1946.  His military career is google-worthy, including flying 101 combat missions during the Korean War.  His long list of military decorations includes the Order of the Sword, the highest honor bestowed upon a commander by his non-commissioned officer corps.  What a national treasure in a great hat.

In spite of the rain in Charlotte over Memorial Day Weekend, The Coca-Cola Company rallied for the Coca-Cola 600 to commemorate those who made the ultimate sacrifice.  We all honored the Gold Star Families, who are a vital part of our country's military and may they always feel supported as they continue healing from their loss.
