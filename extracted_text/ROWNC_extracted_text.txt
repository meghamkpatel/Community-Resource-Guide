FUTURE PLANS
For more than a decade, RowNC’s CHaOS Rowing club has been rowing out of Crosswinds Marina on Jordan Lake, NC. This location has been used not just by CHaOS and Jordan Lake Rowing Club, a junior rowing program, but also by local Universities, including  University of North Carolina’s and Duke University. One of the main advantages of Jordan Lake is that it provides year round access to on the water training.
RowNC is currently working towards establishing a more permanent location for its Master’s rowing club; a location that would also cater for all rowers in the Triangle area for both practice and competition.
As stated in RowNC’s Mission statement, we hope to “
Use the sport of rowing as an economic development initiative to enhance Jordan Lake and surrounding areas as a recreational resource for the Triangle region.
” We continue to talk to all stakeholders involved in this effort in the hope of making this a reality soon.
