Donation Points are changing
14 May 2024
Pickysaurus
We're changing how we reward mod authors in our community through our Donation Points system. DP earned from April 2024 onwards will be calculated using a new algorithm intended to distribute the pool of points more fairly to mod authors who make great content for the community. While we get the details ironed out, you won't see the usual reports on your wallet page at the end of each month for a little while. Don't worry though, the system isn't going anywhere and we're still putting the same a...

What’s been going on recently with the Nexus Mods site?

We know this has been incredibly frustrating for you and it’s frustrating for us as well. We have spent two weekends battling to keep the site running as best we can and will continue to work at all hours to try and ensure as smooth an experience as possible.

Fallout 4 Next-Gen Update is coming!
18 Apr 2024
Pickysaurus
Hot on the heels of the Fallout TV show, a big update to Fallout 4 is scheduled to drop on 25 April. Here's a quick rundown of what's happening and what you need to know to bump up your intelligence stat leading up to the release.
What's included in the Fallout 4 Next-Gen Update?
Bethesda announced their intent to update Fallout 4 for "Next-Gen" (now "Current-Gen", I suppose) consoles and PCs back in 2022, so it's not completely unexpected but you'll be forgiven f...

Free Premium for Mod Authors
13 Feb 2024
Happybara
We launched our Donation Points System in 2018 to give back to the mod authors on Nexus Mods who have given so much to all of us in our community. To date, we have paid out over $7 million USD to our mod authors via this system. The DP system allows authors to earn points which they could redeem for PayPal payouts, discounted games and, until recently, discounted Premium Memberships. These included Lifetime Premium Memberships, which is something we stopped selling back in 2021 for our nor...

10 Billion Downloads

Demorphic
A beast of monstrous proportions is approaching. We spotted it a while back, lumbering over the horizon. It has since picked up such momentum that its arrival is now upon us.
The site will hit 10 billion file downloads today.
This is an epic milestone for Nexus Mods and the modding community. To put this number into perspective:
If every download were a footstep, you could walk to the moon 11 times (1), or walk The Seven Thousand Steps (2) to High Hroth...

Palworld and Pokémon
24 Jan 2024
Demorphic
Palworld continues to break records on Steam, racking up 1,864,421 unique concurrent players in the past 24 hours. At least 4 of those uniques are in the Nexus Mods offices, where after-hours ‘research’ is being conducted.
Whether you think this game has arrived out of the blue, or was an obvious hit, one thing is clear; It bears a lot of similarity to an existing game franchise you may have encountered, namely Pokémon. We won’t go into detail about potential similarities; suf...
