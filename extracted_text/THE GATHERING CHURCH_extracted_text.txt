We know what that struggle feels like.
Church can be messy and awkward, but we started The Gathering so everyone would have a place where they are known and cared for. No one should have to do life on their own. True community – while being difficult to find – is worth the struggle.
Plan Your Visit
We weren't made to
struggle alone.
It’s time to step into a life full of purpose and belonging.
Everyone has a story and
your story matters.
Unreachable | Life Transformation Stories
There is power in your story! We all have DIFFERENT stories that God wants to use to REACH different people.

Refuse to settle for
less
than what God made you for.
You are loved.
Come this Sunday to see what God will do in and through you.
You have a place here.
Community doesn’t just happen on Sunday. Join a group to find your place.
You are family.
Let’s walk the journey of life together.

You weren't made to live life
on your own.
We hope to see you this Sunday.
