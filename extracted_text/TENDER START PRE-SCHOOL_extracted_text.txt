Tender Shepherd Preschool
EACH CHILD IS A UNIQUE GIFT FROM GOD
In the preschool years, children develop the values, character, and attitude that will take them through school and through life. At Tender Shepherd Preschool, we give your children the best possible start by nurturing in them a love of learning, a love for others, and above all, a love for Jesus.
Our goal is to help children develop in the following ways:
Physically:
Children gain small and large motor skills by playing outside on our playground, inside in the gym, and throughout our well-equipped classrooms.
Cognitively:
Through activities that encourage creativity, imagination, and invention, children become problem solvers who think outside the box.
Spiritually:
With Bible lessons integrated into each learning unit, children learn who God is, the blessings he gives us, the promises he keeps, and how we can serve him by serving others.
Emotionally:
We help children transition from home into a group environment and lay a foundation for their security and confidence by teaching them that God loves them unconditionally.
Socially:
Through group activities where we listen, share, and work together, children practice being a friend, making friends, and resolving conflicts.
Linguistically:
Children learn to express their ideas and questions verbally through stories, music, and conversation. We also encourage a lifelong love of reading through a partnership with our local library.
