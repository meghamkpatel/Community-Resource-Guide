Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E)
If your service-connected disability limits your ability to perform activities of daily living and you can't return to work right away, you may qualify for independent living services through
VR&E's Independent Living track
.
VR&E participants can now electronically sign and return documents to their counselor through the e-VA portal. Ask your counselor to opt into e-VA today!
Hear the stories of real soldiers and Service members who worked with the Army Recovery Care Program (ARCP) and Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) program while in transition to help them achieve their goals.
Learn about what VR&E's Five Tracks can offer you by watching

How to Apply
For Veterans and Service members
You may receive Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) (Formerly known as Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment) services to help with job training, education, employment accommodations, resume development, and job seeking skills coaching. Other services may be provided to assist Veterans and Service members in starting their own businesses or independent living services for those who are severely disabled and unable to work in traditional employment. To learn more about the VR&E program, review the
VR&E Process page
, and the tabs and links on this page. Click on the "How to Apply" tab to apply for VR&E services.
For Employers
Veterans leave military service with a wealth of transferable skills and professional experiences. Salary subsidies, assistive technology,
non-paid work experiences, and special employer incentives may be available from VA to help you hire those who have served. Explore what VA offers to make hiring or rehiring a Veteran with a service-connected disability that much easier.
If you are an employer who is interested in hiring VR&E participants, contact us at
employmentsrv.vbaco@va.gov
.
For Family Members
If you support a Veteran or Servicemember with a service-connected disability, who faces difficult employment challenges, there may be little left in the household budget for your higher education and career advancement. VA may offer assistance to help you assess your career goals and abilities, find your next job, further your education and skills, and identify places where you can get job training.
VA may extend vocational counseling and support to family members on topics including:
Education and Career Counseling
Readjustment Counseling
Career Assessments
Benefits for Children with Disabilities (Chapter 18)
Dependent Educational Assistance (Chapter 35)
Choosing a School
