Kids need Kiwanis
Who we are
Kids need adults who care
.
That’s
why people join Kiwanis clubs. They’re local groups of like-minded volunteers who make a difference.
Friends. Neighbors. Anyone who loves serving together
to change children’s lives
. In fact,
Kiwanians are
part of a global network of clubs and members who partner with each other and with organizations whose missions align with ours.
All around the world — and in communities like yours — Kiwanis International is serving the kids who need us most.
