Mission Statement & Program
The mission of Gethsemane Outreach is to provide a safe, Biblically structured environment for men in need who have a genuine desire to defeat their hurts, habits, and hang-ups.
Gethsemane Outreach provides a safe place to live, meals, and other needs for the men during their transition and aftercare regardless of their financial resources.
Bible studies and attendance at church services and classes, as well as Celebrate Recovery, help men slowly build upon Christ for their self-esteem and confidence. Spiritual disciplines such as accountability, Scripture reading, Bible study, prayer and Scripture memory aid in personal spiritual development.
The Gethsemane Outreach Program helps men be accountable for their own feelings, actions and behaviors by making them aware of the consequences of reckless actions and the need to thoroughly weigh consequences before acting. The program helps men seek realistic daily goals for themselves by supporting carefully thought out objectives that are well within their reach.
Program Description
Gethsemane Outreach is a faith-based recovery program that provides transitional and aftercare living structure to men who want help in making the change from past addictive lifestyles to productive every day living. The men are housed in three different homes with up to eight men in each home. Two homes are starter homes (transitional) and one is a graduation home (aftercare). Gethsemane Outreach is available twenty four hours a day for men in crisis (men needing immediate services). Non-alcoholic Veterans in need of temporary housing may be placed in the aftercare home.
Men in the transition homes receive concentrated training for defeating their chemical addiction. Other training includes life skills such as spiritual, social/personal, home and career development. Once men are stable in their environment and development, Gethsemane Outreach finds them a safe job where they are not exposed to drugs and alcohol. Training and supervision continue until promotion to the aftercare home. In the aftercare home, the men are more independent and stay until they demonstrate the ability to live on their own.
Statement of Need
“The choices and behaviors of people, such as diet, physical activity, alcohol, tobacco and other drug use affects both physical and mental health outcomes. In overall health, Arkansas ranked 49th among all U.S. states according to America’s Health Rankings for 2014.14 Several key determinants of health, including behavioral factors, community and environmental factors, health policies, and clinical care determinants, as well as health outcomes, such as disease states, poor physical and mental health days, and death rates were utilized to create state rankings of overall health.” “Consequences of substance use can be related to substance use in general, caused by specific substances (e.g. liver damage caused by alcohol consumption), and/or related to the route of administration (e.g. damage to the lungs caused by smoking). For example, in 2013, Arkansas had 14,641 drug-related arrests. This includes possession, sales and manufacturing arrests. Of these arrests, 48 percent were marijuana- or hashish-related arrests, and 21 percent were stimulant-related arrests. Other drugs, opiates and unknown or unspecified drugs accounted for the rest of the drug-related arrests. (Amphetamines also include methamphetamine. Opiates include heroin, morphine, opium and other narcotics. Other drugs include more than three types of drugs, other stimulants, hallucinogens and depressants, such as barbiturates.)
"The nonmedical use of prescription pain relievers (opiates) has decreased since 2007-2008 among 18-25 year-olds, while staying almost the same in adults ages 26 and older. Compared with national estimates, Arkansas has a higher percentage of adults using pain relievers for nonmedical use. This may indicate that, while other states have made headway in curbing abuse of prescription pain relievers, Arkansas has not."
According to Arkansas Attorney General, Leslie Rutledge, Arkansas has been hit hard, with drug overdose deaths in the state rising from just over 100 in 1999 to more than 400 in 2016.
Garland County Key Findings:
Weaknesses:
➤ 3rd highest rate of adults reporting excessive drinking habits
➤ 4th highest rate for alcohol- or other drug-related crashes
➤ 7th highest rate of students reporting parental attitude favorable toward anti-social behavior
➤ 8th highest rate of births to women using alcohol during pregnancy
➤ 8th highest rate of total crime index offenses
➤ 9th highest suicide rate
➤ 10th highest rate of youth illicit drug use
➤ 10th highest rate of substance abuse arrests
Statistics are from the 2015 Arkansas Epidemiological State Profile of Substance Use and Arkansas Attorney General.
What is the specific need addressed by this program?
Hot Springs has several facilities for men who are trying to be freed from drug addiction. Gethsemane Outreach is a facility that does NOT require entry fees or weekly fees for indigent men who struggle with addiction. This is the only known program with a crisis bed (a twenty-four hour stay which is available anytime 24-7).
How was the need identified and what sources verified it?
Gethsemane Outreach was started when there were three men sleeping in the lobby of a church and they had no where else to go.
The need was identified by researching the amount of drug abuse in our state, county and city and the consequences on such abuse. The rate of success in faith-based programs is greater than in secular programs for transitional living.

To Whom it May Concern:
For the past few years it has been my pleasure to work in a small way with the Gethsemane Outreach, Inc. I have found Gethsemane to be an effective ministry in assisting men in recovery by providing a safe and faith-based program giving them the opportunity to return to productive lives or in some cases to begin new lives absence the burdens of the past. During their journey to recovery the men of Gethsemane have also been able to learn to ministry to others by participating in a variety of community projects.
Warm regards,
Lance & Daris Hudnell
Provide Impact Statement
$5,000 a month provides up to 21 men with needed housing, meals, transportation, recovery training, maintenance, utilities and basic supplies.
What will UW Funding specifically be used for? (SPECIFICALLY)
Five thousand dollars a month is the minimum amount needed to provide housing, meals, transportation, recovery training, insurance, maintenance, utilities, and basic supplies for up to 21 men. All workers at Gethsemane are volunteers. There are no paid workers. Gethsemane House is dependent on donations and percentage of income from men who have progressed to working..All of the money will be used to meet their basic needs for living and transitioning.
This funding will provide stability to the budget and will help reduce the continuing credit card debt.It will enable Gethsemane to start working in a positive cash flow instead of a negative cash flow.
What will UW funding allow you to do that otherwise could not be done? Why is this important?
The UW funding will allow Gethsemane Outreach to keep accepting men without an entry fee and to keep receiving crisis calls 24-7 from men who are in need.
This is important because Gethsemane Outreach is the only men's facility providing faith-based recovery with open enrollment opportunities.
Is this program sustainable? If yes, what is your long term plan for sustaining this program?
Yes, this program is sustainable. The program manager has in place a peer-system for leadership. The manager is training men to do program directing and training. Because of the ongoing need in our community for such a program, donations will continue.
What effect will the program have on the entire population or problem situation?
During the program, residents are encouraged to interact with their family groups so the program goes farther than the men themselves. Men are encouraged to invite family members to attend Celebrate Recovery classes and church services with them. This provides the basis for spiritual support and for transitioning back into the families.
The program will help the entire population by taking these men off the streets, giving them support to break their addictions, and transitioning them back to families and jobs so they will become productive members of our society.
Will the funds provided by United Way of the Ouachitas be matched by another agency, program, grant or foundation? If Yes, by how much?
No.

Success Story from the past 12 months
1. Shaun came to Gethsemane Outreach (GO) from Fort Smith, AR where he had a lot of baggage from the past with his family. After his arrival at the GO House, he relapsed twice and was transferred to Levi Hospital, then he returned to GO. It was a “close ride” with Shaun in many areas. Once his faith came down from his head to his heart, he became a different person working out the challenging road of sober living ahead of him. He now has over one year of clean, sober living. His family is back in his life. His driver’s license, which had been revoked, was restored when he presented his completion of the program certificate to the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration. His work ethic at his job, which was formed while in GO, helped him obtain a truck. He is now reaching out to the men of GO and assists his fellow man whenever possible. He is living out what he learned as a part of the Gethsemane Ministry.
2. While providing showers and haircuts to the homeless at one of the GO houses for the United Way homeless count, we met a fellow man in dire need. He was a Veteran, recently released, in need of overnight lodging and next day transportation to the Greyhound Bus Depot in Malvern, AR. He had a bus ticket to his hometown, but no provisions for lodging or meals before the journey nor transportation to the Bus Depot. Sleeping on the street was his only option. Being on the streets might have resulted in a negative outcome for him. His circumstances were evaluated and the decision was made to grant him a spot in our “Men in Crisis Bed”. Gethsemane Outreach gave him an overnight stay, meals and provided him with GO van transportation to Malvern to meet his bus the next morning. He arrived home safely and was reunited with his family.
3. Jason was picked up by the Gethsemane Outreach Director from National Park Hospital, Hot Springs, AR upon his discharge. He had liver failure caused by alcohol abuse. He had nowhere to go. His condition was so serious that he was turned down for a liver transplant. Doctors predicted he would live approximately 7 months. Jason survived 8 months at the GO house. He was ministered to, cared for, and his medical, physical and spiritual needs were met. The GO House residents gave him support during his final journey in life and he now lives with Jesus. The experience and reality of Jason’s death brought a visible closeness to the men of GO. Together they helped a man transition through a difficult time in life caused by poor decisions to a new life which was the result of a good decision.
