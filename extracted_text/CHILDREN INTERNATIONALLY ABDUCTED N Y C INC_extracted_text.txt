Why the IRC
I support the IRC because I believe everyone should have an opportunity to seek a better future for themselves. My family had that opportunity and I’m so very grateful for it.

Refugee stories from around the world
In their own words, people share when and why they had to flee—and what life is like now.
El Salvador does not allow people like us: either you are a man or you are a woman. My dream upon arriving in the United States is to find a decent job, to have an income to help my parents.
At 27 years old, Fernanda Levin was forced to leave behind her parents, siblings and home simply so that she could safely be herself.
Meet Fernanda
It’s been so horrible, reading the news and wondering where family members are. All my relatives are in eastern Ukraine and I am afraid of what could happen to them.
Newly engaged and working amid the conflict and crisis at home, Ukrainian refugee Anastasiia is rebuilding her life in Poland.
Meet Anastasiia
My children motivate me to continue. I know that I do this not only for me, but for them, so that they do not have any problems when they grow up, so that they do not live or sleep in fear.
Natalia and her husband José traveled thousands of miles, sleeping rough on the streets, determined to reach a safe place to raise their children.
