Welcome to
Durham Ballet Theatre
The performing arts are gifts meant to be shared.
This is our mantra; this is why we do what we do.
Durham Ballet Theatre is committed to providing intensive pre-professional training to a diverse group of dancers. Our focus is on inclusive and accessible public performance opportunities for those communities that are under-served culturally, economically and artistically in the Durham community.

REPERTOIRE
special audiences
get involved
On our opening Friday evening performance for each of our storybook ballets every Spring, we open our doors to an audience of community members who often face barriers in access to the arts due to having a disability or being underserved culturally, economically or artistically. We believe these communities deserve access to high-quality performances and every year, for the past 10 years, DBT has delivered to nearly 5,000 individuals and families.
In 2019, we invited over 1,000 families to attend one of our free performances. Those invited included persons from Genesis Home and TROSA, as well as families associated with The Autism Society of NC, Miracle League and Reality Ministries. These audiences return year after year because our productions are some of the few in the area offering not only quality access. but also quality artistry.
As important as why we do this, is how we do this.
Generous donations and sponsorships inside and outside the Durham community make it possible for all to experience the beauty and healing power of performing arts.
Each of our performance weekends at the Carolina Theatre costs approximately $42,000 to produce.
These funds are raised via:
Ticket sales (33% of funding)
Grants from Fletcher Fund, City of Durham, and Durham Arts Council (14% of funding)
Donors, volunteers and sponsors: (the remaining 53% of funding)
