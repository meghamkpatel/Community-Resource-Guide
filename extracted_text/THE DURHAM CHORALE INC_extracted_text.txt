​Choral Society of Durham
Sharing beautiful, meaningful choral music with our community
DonatE
We are a choir based in Durham, NC, that has been committed to building and celebrating community through choral music for over
70 years
.
Our Mission
​
To unite singers and audiences in the joy of high-quality performance of time-honored choral masterworks and an ever-broadening range of excellent repertoire from many traditions.
To strengthen our community by engaging with the rich diversity of its people and building transformative connections as a force for unity.
2023-24 Season
Planning is well underway for our 2023-24 season. We'll be celebrating our 75th year, so we're going to be busy! The season kicks off with a performance on the very first day of the season, when we'll be singing at Durham's annual Festival for the Eno.
For information on this and our current plans for the rest of the year,
