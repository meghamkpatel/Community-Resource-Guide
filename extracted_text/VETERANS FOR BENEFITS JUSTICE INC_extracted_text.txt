OUR HISTORY
On April 18th, 1979, a group of veterans from all military branches, representing enlistees from WWII through Vietnam, came together to assist veterans with problems. Some immediate problems faced were racism and racist policies, little or poor medical and rehabilitative services, unemployment and no re-entry preparation. Many soldiers leaving the military did not know their rights or the agencies willing to help them.
