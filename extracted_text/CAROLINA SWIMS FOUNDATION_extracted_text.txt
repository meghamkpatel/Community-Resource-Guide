Carolina Swims Foundation has "Given the Gift of Swim" to over 500 children in North Carolina.  By giving children the opportunity to learn how to swim, children advance their sensory tools for cognition, physical and mental health development.  The children build physical strength, confidence in their ability to problem solve and knowledge of water safety.  Water is a calming stimulate for individuals with sensory needs.  Many children in the foster care system would never otherwise have the opportunity to learn how to swim.  Giving children the survival life skill of swimming will safeguard their life.  Sadly, many children have survived early neglect and/or abuse, and as a result have sensory processing issues.  Swimming/Aqua-therapy can help to heal and advance a child's sensory processing abilities, improve cognition, improve gross and fine motor skills empowering them with the survival life skill that can save their life.  Carolina Swims Foundation combats the rates of drowning by "G
iving the Gift of Swim"
to underserved children and children in foster care. We are passionate about saving future lives and helping children through the medium of swimming to develop mastery in their own lives.

"In the absence of North Carolina swimming laws requiring lifeguard standards for all kids, Carolina Swims is setting new standards when it comes to guarding against the waste and terror of drowning.  Carolina Swims is reducing the risk of drowning by increasing the number of qualified guards around the water.  If you know a child—any child—then you have a reason for being invested in Carolina Swims," stated Dr. Jeffrey Brown.
