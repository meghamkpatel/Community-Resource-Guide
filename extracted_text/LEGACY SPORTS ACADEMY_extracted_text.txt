LEGACY SPORTS ACADEMY
Legacy Sports Academy is a state-of-the art multi-sport complex featuring the largest indoor facility in Arkansas with over 20,000 square feet of indoor artificial padded turf. Legacy's primary athletic training and development focuses around baseball and softball. The 9,000 square foot Performance Center contains six 70' batting/pitching cages and a 100' x 14' strength/conditioning training area. The 12,000 square foot Field-house contains 110' x 110' of padded turf and netting with two retractable batting/pitching cages. The Fieldhouse accommodates a 90' baseball infield with adjustable bases for baseball/softball base path distances.

Our mission is to leave a Legacy for our youth delivering a True Athletic Experience that teaches character traits such as leadership, teamwork, respect, sportsmanship, positive attitude, solid work ethic, and athletic development, all while learning necessary life lessons and honoring God with their abilities.
In order to achieve this mission Legacy Sports Academy provides a children friendly atmosphere conducive to learning team skills, growing families closer, and providing guidance to children in need while allowing them to have fun in a sports atmosphere. We accomplish this by making sure we provide a facility and staff geared toward teaching children the appropriate skills they need to succeed not only in sports, but also in life. In doing this we develop a Legacy of young athletes who become confident, responsible, and respectable leaders of our community.
