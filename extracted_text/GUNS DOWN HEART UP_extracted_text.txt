Our writers break down headlines from around the Triangle, every weekday.
Every Saturday starting at 2:00 p.m., a small group of people marches on the sidewalk along East Main Street in Durham, from South Dillard Street to North Elizabeth Street. The marchers have one thing in common: All have lost a loved one to gun violence in the city. They are parents, siblings, caretakers, and friends. A few of them are mothers who lost children this summer. Many of these murders remain unsolved. The group is demanding that the community and City government come together to seek justice.
