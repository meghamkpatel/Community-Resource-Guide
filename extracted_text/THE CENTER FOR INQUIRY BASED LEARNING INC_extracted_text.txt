EXCITEMENT FOR SCIENCE
(It’s natural for CIBL!)
Get to know The Center for Inquiry-Based Learning, a Durham NC nonprofit specializing in hands-on STEM for North Carolina’s K-8 classrooms. Our vision is to nurture the natural excitement children have doing science.
These Folks Think We Hung the Moon…

5th Grade Teacher – Alamance-Burlington School System
“I would use as many kits as I could get my hands on! The kits impact the experience and knowledge for my students more than I could ever describe in a survey. They leave my classroom with science experience, motivation, inquisitive science points of view, and enriched science lives!”
K-5 Teacher
“I love using the CIBL science kits because every child, no matter their academic ability, is able to shine in some way. Several students that struggle in school in general are engaged and sharing ideas. It’s my most favorite part of the day!”
