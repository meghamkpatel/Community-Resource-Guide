Starlyn Lockhart
I moved to North Carolina several years ago from Pennsylvania in search of a new job. Because I am visually impaired, I knew that finding a job was going to be a challenge. I was looking for a company that would give me the opportunity to learn a new skillset. After being with LCI for a little over 4 years, I can say that this company is what I was looking for.

I like the inclusivity of LCI in that they are trying to make changes in upper management to be able to increase the upward mobility of people who are blind . I also Like that we as people who are blind are given the chance to reach our potential throughout the company.

George Mason
I like working at LCI for numerous reasons. Foremost, working has helped me to regain my self-respect and my dignity. Because of my vision loss, I was unemployed and I had lost all confidence in myself. Here at LCI, I am part of a team. I am accepted and respected. There are opportunities for me to be upwardly mobile within the company. I am proud to be a part of LCI’s mission.

Leon Woods
The reason I like working at LCI is because it affords people with vision impairment to be independent. That is the greatest opportunity for me.

Robert Hilton
I like that I work with a team that feels like family and that together we serve and support soldiers. I also feel like I’ve had the opportunity to grow personally in skills and leadership and have been able to watch our store grow as well.
