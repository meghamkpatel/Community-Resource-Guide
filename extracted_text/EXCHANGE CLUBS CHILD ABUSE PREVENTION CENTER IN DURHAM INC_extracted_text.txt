Supporting Children and the Adults in their lives.
Exchange Family Center has been working for 30 years to better the lives of children in Durham and to keep families together. We use a multi-prong approach — providing support and training for families, caregivers and childcare professionals, as well as working to raise community awareness. Anyone and everyone can play a part in creating safe and responsive environments for children.
Parent & Caregiver Support
As adults, we are responsible for ensuring children have safe, nurturing, and healthy environments. Being a caregiver isn't always simple or easy, though. We have a number of programs that can help.

Childcare provider
training & support
As a childcare provider, you can have a tremendous impact on a child's life by developing protective factors that shield them from abuse, and from the negative outcomes of traumatic events.

opportunities To Help
Supporting children is something we can and should do together — as a community. Volunteer assistance, financial support and in-kind donations are all valuable. No gift of time or resources is too small.

Our Programs Make a Difference
Here are a few success stories.
Early Childhood Outreach Program
When the Exchange Family Center’s EChO program closed a case at a childcare center the teachers remarked that her involvement had helped not only the referred child, but the teachers and the rest of the class. The referred child’s aggression was curbed and he now uses more words to solve his problems. The whole class is running more smoothly with teachers who know more about how to assist children with problem-solving.
Family Support Program
One child referred to the Exchange Family Center’s Family Support program struggling in school and with his homework, causing stressful evenings at home. His mother learned skills to help him focus, stay calm, and complete his homework, improving his grades and functioning in his classroom and leading to a happier home life.
Parenting of Adolescents Program
A teen was referred to the Exchange Family Center due to his gang membership and arrest for robbery. The Parenting of Adolescents program worked with the teen and his grandmother together. Now the teen is headed to graduation in June and a job with Durham Parks and Rec this summer.
