Who We Are
The Emily Krzyzewski Center, a nonprofit organization in Durham, North Carolina, implements four distinct programs designed to build on the academic, career, and leadership potential of students who are traditionally underrepresented in higher education. Collectively, our programs serve students from elementary school through college and equip them with the skills necessary to successfully complete higher education, connect to promising careers, and become agents of change within their communities.
