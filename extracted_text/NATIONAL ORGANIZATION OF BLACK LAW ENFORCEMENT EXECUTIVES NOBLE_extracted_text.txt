Our Member's Thoughts
"I joined NOBLE to be amongst top-level leaders whose collective goal is to strengthen the law enforcement community and influence legislation that impacts marginalized communities. Being a part of an organization whose values and principles reflect the integrity of policing, is paramount to me. NOBLE has made me conscious about my duties and responsibilities as a police officer and Black American. "
Rashidi Johnson
Chapter President
"As a black female officer, I understand the impact I can have to effectuate change in our community. That is why I applied for membership with NOBLE because of its history, mission, vision, and its beliefs in outreach and community service. Since joining, I have not only gained a new family in law enforcement all over the world, but it has also impacted my passion for public service by providing me with more resources and trainings to help better serve my community. "
Angela Mathews
Region 5 Member
"“Equity” and “justice” – these are the words that mean the most to me in NOBLE’s mission. The women and men of this organization are working hard each and every day in the name of equity and justice to make communities safer across the nation. When I look back at my involvement with NOBLE since I joined until now, I think about the positive impact the organization has had over the years and I’m thankful for this network of professional colleagues."
Natalie Ammons
Chapter President, Georgia Chapter
"It is an honor and a privilege to be a part of an organization where other professionals resemble me, and that takes pride in finding solutions to the problems within law enforcement. NOBLE has inspired me to be a better person and leader. It has pushed me to motivate others and instill my own philosophy to bring unity among our own, to look at the criminal justice system and find ways to build trust, and to close the gap between law enforcement and the communities we serve."
Bobby Barrows
Executive Director & Chief of Police
"I joined NOBLE in 2015 at the urging of my current Chief, Clayton A. Harris. I quickly realized my association with NOBLE was necessary for personal growth and professional development. Joining NOBLE strengthened and stimulated my desire for civic engagement. NOBLE has made me a better leader; it has increased my awareness on the complex moral and civic dimensions of my community’s social problems and created a platform for our chapter to act."
Thomas McMillan
Lieutenant
"I joined NOBLE towards the end of my undergraduate degree at Bowie State University seeking an organization that would provide me with support and guidance into my career field. I received just that the second I joined and became a member of the Washington Metro Chapter. I have gained lifelong connections and memories that will last. This organization has provided me with skills and knowledge that I can use every day."
Bilqees Stover
Member, Washington DC Metro Chapter
