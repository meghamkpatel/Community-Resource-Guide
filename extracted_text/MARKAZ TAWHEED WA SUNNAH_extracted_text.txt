By the permission of Allah, since 2002 Markaz Tawheed Wa Sunnah (MTWS) has established the Dawah of Islam in our City of Durham, North Carolina, and the surrounding community.
Our Masjid is located in the Research Triangle Park (RTP) which is the largest research park in the United States. It is named for the three hub cities of Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill, or more properly, for the three major research universities in those three cities North Carolina State University, Duke University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, respectively.
This strategic location provides us with a platform to launch Dawah programs to local universities, secondary schools, news media, radio stations and churches, while providing a place for Friday prayer and daily prayers for the many Muslims who work in the Research Triangle Park.

About the Book
Almost everyone is familiar with the universal greeting of Islam, “As- Salaamu Alaikum (Peace be upon you)”. The yearly pilgrimage to Mecca is witnessed by Muslims and Non-Muslims worldwide. Ramadan is recognized as the month wherein Muslims abstain from food and drink from daybreak until sunset. Nearly everyone has a Muslim co-worker, associate, classmate, or relative; however, many people are not well-acquainted with the actual beliefs of Islam.
This is a glimpse into the most misunderstood, misrepresented—yet fastest-growing—religion in the world.
This is Islam.
