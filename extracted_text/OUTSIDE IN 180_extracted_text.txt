CSP outside of 180 days ETP/Waiver ?
So there is a super cool CISCO CSP program on post that will start earlier than 180 days before my ETS. We're talking like a month and some change earlier than when I will be eligible and I just find it kind of absurd that I can't get this training to potentially secure great civilian employment because I got unlucky with my ETS date. Is there any waiver/ ETP ? Got a great command team and know they'll try it if it's possible plus I got like 110 leave days too I wouldn't mind just using to be able to attend the course. If not looks like the only other CSP I can do is an auto collision class which is cool but I got a TS so that Cisco class is better for me.
