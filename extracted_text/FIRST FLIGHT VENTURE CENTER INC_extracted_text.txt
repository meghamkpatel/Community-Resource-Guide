LET’S GET STARTED
We have labs, office spaces, programs, and so much more!
We are not a real estate company with long term leases. We’re a non-profit with a mission to help you develop your idea, create your prototype, secure grants, launch your business, and in doing so, we create jobs and grow the economy of North Carolina.
Our focus is on creating the support you need, not square foot pricing or occupancy rates. Our spaces are affordable and customizable wet labs, offices, power drops, sinks whatever you need. And our flexible leases evolve with you.
25,000 SQUARE FEET OF CONFIGURABLE SPACE
