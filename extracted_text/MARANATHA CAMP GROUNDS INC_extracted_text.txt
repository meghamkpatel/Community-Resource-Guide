Retreats For Youth, Families,
Individuals, and Couples
We believe that we ourselves, our children, and our families need regular opportunities to be renewed, refreshed, and reconnected with themselves and each other, away from the frenzy of our day-to-day, worldly lives. Maranatha facilitates these crucial experiences by hosting a variety of summer camps for youth of all ages — as well as year-round family retreats, community events, Christian discipleship programs, and more for other ages and life stages of guests.
