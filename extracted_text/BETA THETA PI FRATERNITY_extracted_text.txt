General Convention Returns Home
Beta is coming home for its annual reunion! Join Beta brothers, Sweethearts and guests at the 185th General Convention on the campus of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.

Visit iconic Beta heritage sites across campus, from the Beta Campanile to the Hall of Chapters to the Alpha Chapter house. Take a trip to the grave site of Founder John Reily Knox up the road in Greenville, Ohio. Stand near the spot where the founders changed the course of history some 185 years ago. In conjunction with the 25th anniversary year of the Institute for Men of Principle, mark July 25–28, 2024 on your calendar to join attendees from across Beta’s Broad Domain at the 185th anniversary celebration in Oxford.

“The first mark of a Beta will be his Beta spirit.” – Willis O. Robb,

Eight Benefits of Joining a Fraternity Like Beta (and Three Cons, too)
Benefit One
Lifelong Friendships
Men of all ages, especially those embarking on their college journey, need connection and a place where they can just be themselves – a family of choice. Individuals from all walks of life find that sense of belonging in Beta because of its focus on developing close, meaningful relationships.
Benefit Two
A More Fulfilling College Experience
Research shows fraternity membership results in higher levels of student engagement, collaborative learning, student-faculty interactions, and involvement in curricular and co-curricular activities. Members report being more satisfied with their college experience overall.
Benefit Three
Community Connection
Community service and philanthropy are a significant part of fraternity life and offer members the opportunity to take part in volunteerism while also spending time with friends. Beta Theta Pi doesn’t have an official philanthropic partner, so members and chapters can choose to give back to causes they are passionate about or where they may have the most significant impact locally.
Benefit Four
Leadership Opportunities
Members often hold significant leadership roles both in and out of the brotherhood. Dozens of Betas are elected as student body or interfraternity council president on their campuses each year. In contrast, many more build new skills (or strengthen existing ones), plan significant events and run the organization’s day-to-day operations.
Benefit Five
An Extensive Network
With 140,000 living alumni, the Beta brotherhood is vast. Members are instantly plugged into this network, which may assist in finding a collegiate mentor, accelerating future career and financial endeavors, or fostering community across the globe. It never hurts to be associated with a group of high achievers.
Benefit Six
Academic Assistance
Most fraternities require you to prioritize academics through a minimum GPA (that’s why you’re in college in the first place, after all). Opportunities for study groups and networking with members who share your major are a plus, too. Studies show fraternities members are 20% more likely to graduate than non-members, in fact!
Benefit Seven
Sense of Belonging
Adapting to college life is challenging as it’s nearly everyone’s first experience away from home. It is easy to feel lost or lonely in that type of situation. Fraternities provide an extra sense of comfort with their built-in social networks and focus on developing relationships.
Benefit Eight
Build Your Resume
Not only might your resume catch the eye of a prospective employer who is also a member, but the skills you build throughout your time in a fraternity – teamwork, time management, conflict resolution and event planning, to name a few – are unmatched elsewhere on a college campus.
Con One
Stigma
Some people refuse to see the value of fraternities and see them as nothing more than buying your friends. To them, the experience is about nothing more than Animal House antics. Sometimes they’re right, especially if a group abuses substances or hazes. It’s up to leading fraternities like Beta to prove them wrong.
Con Two
Time Commitment
There’s no doubt about it: Fraternities can be time-consuming. They involve weekly meetings, frequent social events, seasonal intramurals, ongoing service projects, and more. Most Beta chapters will say, “You can be as involved as you want to be.” That’s true, but even a minimum commitment can feel like a real investment to some.
Con Three
Costs
While dues vary among chapters, it’s common for annual fraternity dues to exceed $500. If this is a concern for you, talk it over with the local chapter president. Some groups, like Beta, offer need-based or merit tuition scholarships to help make the experience more affordable.

Beta Theta Pi Foundation Awards Nearly $400,000 in Scholarships
Each year, the Men of Principle Scholarship Program helps individual chapters recognize unaffiliated (non-member) male students who are devoted to the Fraternity’s core values of mutual assistance, intellectual growth, trust, integrity, and responsible conduct – with no obligation to join. Additionally, the Beta Foundation funds need-based relief scholarships to assist members facing financial hardship and ensure the fraternity experience is financially viable for all. Finally, roughly 100 tuition-based merit scholarships are awarded to Betas (undergraduate and graduate) or their sons and daughters each year.

“
"Beta has given me a group of men who I can call my brothers and have no trouble confiding in or having fun with. Being a transfer student, I thought it would be tough to find a good group of people I identified with, but as soon as I found Beta, I found a group of people who gave me a home."
Bryan Golombik,

“
"I am proud to be a Beta because I believe the legacy I have left and the brotherhood I have created are not bound to now but will be with my brothers and me throughout and even after my lifetime. Beta was a place I could call home when I felt like I was far away from home because I had found a group of brothers who excelled in pursuing their life goals, being leaders, playing an active role in their community, bettering themselves every day, and having a great time while doing it."
Rajay Dockery,

“
“There are many stigmas surrounding Greek life on college campuses, but I am part of a group of individuals that follows and lives the values of the organization and helps break barriers for all. Being in Beta allows me to commit to serving a purpose much greater than myself. I am always proud to wear the letters, as a symbol of everything that Beta represents.”
Jairo Becerra,
Oregon
’23
“
“I am proud to be a Beta because we exist with purpose. As Betas, we add meaningful action to our values and vision. When I helped found Beta at James Madison, I wanted to change Greek life and create a new space. Before fall 2018, there was no space at JMU for men to find brotherhood grounded in authenticity. A space where men are built rather than taken down, where brothers find fraternity invulnerability rather than hazing, where grades are held high, and values held close. I’m proud to be a Beta because the brotherhood I helped create was the home many men at JMU finally found that they identified with...”

Beta Theta Pi is home to nearly 185 years of history and tradition. From its earliest days at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, to the establishment of the revolutionary Men of Principle Initiative that made Beta an interfraternal leader, there is much to learn about this Great and Good Fraternity.
