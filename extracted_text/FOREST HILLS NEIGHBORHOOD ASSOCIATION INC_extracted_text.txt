Chlorine Disinfection:
As part of routine maintenance, the Water Department will temporarily change to chlorine disinfection from May 6 – 27. Customers may notice a slight change in the taste or smell of their drinking water. We appreciate your patience during this time.”  (Chuck, thanks for sharing this on FB.)

***IMPORTANT!
Make sure to lock your homes and vehicles overnight or when you are not home.
A white truck was recently stolen in the wee hours of the morning from a neighborhood driveway (thankfully it was found)—suspects are a small group of young adults.
For those who have doorbell or security cameras, check the recordings regularly.  If you see something suspicious, please let your neighbors know & report it to the police!

**Answers about the November water issue affecting pets …:
Yes, the issue connects to the switch back from "free" chlorine to chloramine, but it is also unusual.
For those who understand the chemistry part of this, the "free" chlorine level was 1.2 and the total was 3.8--a bit higher than it should be (per the tech) given our proximity to the water facility. He's taking samples back to the lab to run more thorough testing, including what's in the water and its off-gas.
UPDATE (short version):  Report confirmed the tests from the field.
