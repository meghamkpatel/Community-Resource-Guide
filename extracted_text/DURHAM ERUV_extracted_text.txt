About us
Jewish law has developed a mechanism called an Eruv which transforms an outdoor area into one large symbolic home, within which
carrying is be permitted. The Durham Eruv surrounds Beth El Synagogue and Fleishman House Chabad at Duke University. The Durham Eruv is an area with many family homes that are in walking distance of the synagogue.
