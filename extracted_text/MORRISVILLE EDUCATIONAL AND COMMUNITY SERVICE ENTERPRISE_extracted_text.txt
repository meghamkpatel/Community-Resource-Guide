Our Campuses
The Morrisville campus stretches over 150 acres of bucolic land in Morrisville, NY. More than 48 buildings, athletics fields, service roads and parking facilities and more than 1,000 acres of farm and woodland create an original instructional environment.
The campus is 30 miles southeast of Syracuse and 30 miles southwest of Utica, while being a half-hour drive from the New York State Thruway to provide easy access to Albany (two hours), Rochester (two hours), Buffalo (three hours) and New York City (four hours).
The
Norwich campus
offers quality, personalized education and training to residents and employers of Chenango County and south central New York. The campus is located 30 miles south of Morrisville in downtown Norwich, NY, in the state-of-the-art Roger W. Follett Hall.
The
Syracuse Educational Opportunity Center
(EOC), administered by SUNY Morrisville, provides the urban community of Syracuse with innovative academic programs leading to higher education, as well as vocational training programs leading to gainful employment and economic self-sufficiency. The Syracuse EOC is part of a statewide network of 10 education opportunity centers and two outreach and counseling centers that function as the 65th campus of the State University of New York (SUNY).
Our History and Mission
SUNY Morrisville traces its beginnings to 1908 when it was chartered as the New York State School of Agriculture at Morrisville. It was founded as a progressive public coeducational institution in response to New York's unsafe food systems and spiraling prices in the face of widespread farm abandonment by families. Its mission was to be a true farmer's school, training persons directly for the practical operations of farming. In addition to specialized courses offered in the two program areas of agriculture and home economics, school founders established requirements so that graduates also would be educated broadly in the liberal arts and sciences and would be committed to sustaining both their family enterprises and their local communities.
For its first 80 years, Morrisville offered associate degrees while expanding to more than 50 academic programs, each offering specialized instruction aligned largely to meet the needs of a dynamic New York workforce for technicians and operatives. Beginning in the 1990s, in response to the rising demand for supervisory and entrepreneurial talent in New York's agriculture and technical sectors, Morrisville was authorized to offer bachelor's degrees.
While Morrisville has transitioned into a technologically advanced college with a rich diversity of both bachelor's and associate degree programs, its core mission has remained steadfast throughout its history: to educate and prepare graduates as future leaders in their specialized professions and their communities.
Our Commitment to Hands-On, Applied Education
This historic commitment to hands-on, applied education now involves a wide array of campus-based enterprises and institutes. These operations are campus-supported and integrated into aligned academic programs, with course outcomes requiring that students become engaged in the plans, operations and sustainability of these enterprises.
Examples include:
the
Agricultural and Clean Energy Technology (ACET) Center
, a 30,000 square-foot applied learning facility;
the
Copper Turret
, a full-service restaurant;
the
Arnold R. Fisher Dairy Complex
with 200 milking cows;
the state-of-the art
Equine Rehabilitation Center
furnished with the most modern equipment and therapeutic modalities; and
Nelson Farms
, which offers food-processing services to more than 100 food entrepreneurs with more than 200 products.
Students in the degree programs of
residential construction
,
automotive
,
dairy
,
equine
,
wood products technology
,
culinary arts management
,
diesel technology
,
travel and tourism
,
renewable energy
,
aquaculture
and
horticulture
all realize important career-ready experiences from these enterprises. That list represents a subset only of the college's associate degree programs with these enterprise-based institutes.
For bachelor's degree programs, the commitment to applied learning continues with 95 percent of these graduates completing a full-semester internship requirement for their capstone academic experience. Together, these experiential learning opportunities offer diverse settings for students to create and innovate, design and build, cultivate and harvest, breed and rehabilitate, troubleshoot and repair, analyze and sustain, and diagnose and heal. It is no coincidence that many present-day learning outcomes can trace their origins to those adopted at Morrisville a century ago to promote sustainable farms and communities.
