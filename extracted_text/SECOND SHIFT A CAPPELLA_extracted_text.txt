Second Shift
is an adult a cappella group located in the Triangle (Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill, NC). We’re a co-ed, non-profit group that sings a wide variety of song styles. Take a look around the site to learn more about what we do or how you can hear us.
So, why
Second Shift
, you ask?  Well, all of us have day jobs, and we do this for the love of the music.  Once we fit in other important things such as family, and having an occasional good time, sometimes it seems like there’s little time left over.
Work… Sing… Sleep.  Repeat.   That’s life!
