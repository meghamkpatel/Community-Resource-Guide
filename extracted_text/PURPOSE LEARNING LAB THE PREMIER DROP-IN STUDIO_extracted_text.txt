Why
PLL
?
Purpose Learning Lab’s work is anchored in equity to ensure children and families from marginalized communities are prioritized and elevated through our STEAM Infused workshops, enrichment, and wellness programs. We also provide trauma -informed, evidenced based interventions to at-risk youth, children, teens, and families to reduce community violence and improve quality of life. To advance equity, we aim to reach diverse students and communities to champion change and empower historically underserved, underrepresented populations with greater academic opportunities to achieve brighter futures.
"Science is more than a school subject, or the periodic table, or the properties of waves. It is an approach to the world, a critical way to understand and explore and engage with the world, and then have the capacity to change that world"
— President Barack Obama
