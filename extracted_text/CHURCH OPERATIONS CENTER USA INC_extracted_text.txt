Unique products on a unified platform
Use specialized tools for individual ministries with a shared database.
The center of the Planning Center world is People—a shared database that connects to all the other products.
As you use individual products, you contribute to the larger, integrated system—so you can do specialized work without siloing information.
A scalable system that adapts to your needs
Only sign up for what you’ll use, and pay for what you need.
You can decide which products you want to subscribe to and which plan
levels
—scaling up or down based on what your church needs.
Every product also has a free plan option you can always switch to, or cancel completely with no fees (contracts and cancellation fees aren’t our thing).
And no matter what you select, Planning Center People—the core of your system—will always be free.
30 days free. No contracts. Cancel anytime.

Anyone from your church can get help from support and use training materials anytime.

Planning Center's modular setup ensures we don't pay for features we don't use, but leaves us with options should our needs change and we decide to expand.
