The Triangle J Regional Corporation is a 501(c)3 organization incorporated with the mission of furthering social welfare, protect the environment in the Triangle J Council of Governments' (TJCOG) region, and strengthen economic vitality in Chatham, Durham, Johnston, Lee, Moore, Orange, and Wake counties (the TJCOG region) through cooperative efforts between the public, private, and educational sectors in the region. The Corporation offers additional avenues and resources to TJCOG member governments and partner organizations to further projects and work that improves quality of life across the region.
