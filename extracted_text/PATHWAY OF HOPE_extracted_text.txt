Breaking the Poverty Cycle:
The Pathway of Hope
What Is Pathway of Hope?
The Salvation Army’s Pathway of Hope program was launched in 2011 to provide targeted services to families wanting to break the
generational cycle of poverty
and enable a path out of constant crisis. It is rooted in a case management approach, focusing on the client’s individual needs and mastery of different life skills.
This program is designed to have an impact on how poverty affects multiple generations. By positively changing the lives of parents, The Salvation Army can create better living conditions for children. Educational and support programs for children in their development years are crucial.
The War on Poverty
The United States has the second-highest child poverty rate among the world’s wealthiest nations. And because children who live in poverty for half their lives are much more likely to remain in poverty as adults, the epidemic is passed down from one generation to the next, over and over.
The cost to those families trapped in the cycle of poverty is staggering, but we must also consider that the effects of child poverty cost our country nearly $500 billion per year.
Breaking the Cycle of Poverty
The Salvation Army’s Pathway of Hope initiative marks a pivotal shift to focusing on the core causes of poverty rather than treating the symptoms. Lack of job opportunities, unstable housing, and an underserved educational environment can all be major challenges for someone looking to lead a self-sustainable life.
With our help, people living in poverty can break the cycle of crisis and vulnerability and lead families down a path toward increased stability for years to come. It’s a pathway of hope for current and future generations.
Life skills are key
The Pathway of Hope approach includes:
Catalyzing community collaboration in service of shared clients
Providing targeted services to families with a desire to take action, changing life trajectories and increasing hope
Moving families from crises and vulnerability to stability and eventually self-sufficiency, tracking family progress along the way
Bringing all The Salvation Army’s internal resources to bear, aligned to the goals of clients
Focusing on hope as a measured outcome, which represents the distinctly relational, spiritual outcome that The Salvation Army seeks in the work it does
What does the initiative involve?
Caring for your family’s needs, while building a strong future, can be challenging in today’s economic times. The Salvation Army team will offer support, guidance, and assistance as we walk alongside you on your family’s journey:
