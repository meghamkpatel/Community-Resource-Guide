The concept of kendo is to discipline the human character through the application of the principles of the katana (sword).
The purpose of kendo is to mold the mind and body, to cultivate a vigorous spirit, and through correct and rigid training to strive for improvement in the art of kendo, to hold in esteem human courtesy and honor, to associate with others with sincerity, and forever pursue the cultivation of oneself. This will make one able to love his/her country and society, to contribute to the development of culture and to promote peace and prosperity among all peoples.
