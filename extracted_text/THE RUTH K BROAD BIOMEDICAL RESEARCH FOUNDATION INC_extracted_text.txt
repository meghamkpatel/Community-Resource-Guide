The Ruth K. Broad Biomedical Research Foundation, Inc., a support corporation of Duke University, funds research in the neurosciences with a specific focus on investigation that may advance the knowledge or treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Pilot studies that can lead to conventional funding are preferred, to focus the Foundation’s support on new rather than existing research.
The Foundation has several grant programs for basic research in the neurosciences, both at Duke and outside of Duke, as well as a seminar series held at Duke.
To honor the memory of Ruth K. Broad and to expand knowledge toward the cause and cure of Alzheimer’s disease, members of her family originally formed the Foundation in 1988.
During 1991 – 1993 the Foundation became a support corporation of Duke University and is managed through the office of Duke Health Development and Alumni Affairs.
The board of directors of the Foundation is made up of Broad family members, physicians and scientists, and Duke advisors.
