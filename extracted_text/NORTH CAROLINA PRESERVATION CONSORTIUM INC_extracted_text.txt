Bringing preservation professionals together to share ideas is one of the hallmarks of the North Carolina Preservation Consortium’s annual conference. Each year we look forward to welcoming many voices to the table to celebrate preservation efforts across the state and to learn from one another. This year’s conference marks NCPC’s 30th Anniversary, a milestone traditionally celebrated with a gift of pearls. Our 2023 sessions focus on sharing pearls of wisdom from the preservation field and explore the question, “What is the best preservation advice you have ever received, and how did you implement it?”
