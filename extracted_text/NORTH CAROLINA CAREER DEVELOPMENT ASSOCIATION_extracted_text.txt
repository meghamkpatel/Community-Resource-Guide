Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging statement
The North Carolina Career Development Association is guided by a strong commitment to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB) across the constituencies we represent, including K-12, higher education, private practice, and industry. We recognize that intersectionality is at the heart of understanding the complex identities and experiences of individuals. We actively engage in conversations about power and privilege, aiming to dismantle structural inequalities within the career development field. By promoting equitable access to resources, advocating for inclusive policies, and fostering a sense of belonging among our members, we strive to create an environment that celebrates diversity, nurtures growth, and ensures that everyone has equal opportunities to thrive in their professional pursuits.
