Durham Community Preschool
A nonprofit, half-day,
*Nature & Play-based*
early childhood program
Dear families,
Thank you for your interest in our preschool.
Unfortunately, we will not be enrolling for the 2024-25 school year and our program is closing. We are an independent, secular, nonprofit preschool that is housed at a church â€“ Glendale Heights UMC. Glendale Heights is, unfortunately, closing their doors after 64 years of worship.
In looking for a new space, we encountered insurmountable barriers. The 2018 building code creates cost prohibitive requirements for us to relocate to any other church in Durham that was built prior to 2018. These building codes would require costly renovations to most church buildings â€“ some that are historic in our area. The other alternative â€“ a commercial space â€“ would require the same upfitting costs along with a 400% rent increase for our program. Neither of these paths forward would be financially sustainable for our program. After five months of intense searching and discussion, our Board of Directors has made the difficult decision to close. We have served the Durham community for 29 years â€“ first as a Parents Morning Out ministry of Calvary United Methodist Church and then as our own 501c3 nonprofit for the last 14 years. We have been honored to be a part of the lives of so many. ðŸ’œ
For resources on other programs in the area, we recommend the following information.
For half-day programs in the area, the
Durham Orange Preschool Association
contains links to 25 programs in Durham and Orange county. There is a list of openings in Durham and Chapel Hill on this website that is updated regularly.
For anyone who has a child turning four before 8/31/24,
DPS Pre-K
is also an option to consider.
We are wishing you well in your preschool search in Durham.
Warmly,
Rose Volponi
Director
