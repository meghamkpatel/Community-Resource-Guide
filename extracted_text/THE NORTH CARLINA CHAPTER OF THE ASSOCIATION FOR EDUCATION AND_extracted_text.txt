Our journey began more than a century ago.
YOURS STARTS NOW
We’ve spent decades working for students and educators—but, there’s still more to do. Like our progress during the civil rights and women’s rights movements, we need to dig in and speak up for the students and educators who are still facing inequality every day.
Advance racial and social justice in our communities and schools.
Ask school boards to ensure safe and equitable learning amid COVID-19
Stand up for racial and social justice

MAKE CHANGE
The politicians in Raleigh have done almost nothing to reverse the long-term cuts to our public schools that are making it harder and harder to give our students the quality education they deserve. Instead of reinvesting in public education, lawmakers would rather give huge tax breaks to millionaires and big corporations. We can, and must, do better.
