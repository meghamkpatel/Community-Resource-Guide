WELCOME
The Youth Education for Savings (YES) Consortium engages youth k-12 and young adults up to age 24 on essential skills focusing on
money management and life skill development to equip and enable them to make sound decisions
.
​
YES’s primary purpose is to combat social-economic inequity and deterioration through financial literacy and enrichment programming.  YES Consortium's balanced and realistic implementation approach creates an environment that offers youth an
applicable
skill set for real-life sustainable and enriching lives now and in their future.
"The YES program has been working and inspiring children just like me to save money and even begin my career as an entrepreneur.
​
​- Diamond Estes, HS Grad Class of 2017
