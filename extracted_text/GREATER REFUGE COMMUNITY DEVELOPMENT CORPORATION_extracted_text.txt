A New USDA-Funded Center Boosts a Mississippi Community
Posted by Ken Stribling, Mississippi Public Information Coordinator in
Rural
Mar 25, 2011
Over 100 people gathered for the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the Greater Refuge Community Center, which was financed by a USDA loan. (State Director Trina N. George, front row, third from right)
A new community center financed through USDA Rural Development’s
Community Facilities
program was the location of a ribbon-cutting ceremony in Canton, Mississippi last week.
The Greater Refuge Temple Multi-Purpose Resource Center in Canton was built in large part with a loan from USDA Rural Development. The building is a state-of-the-art structure which was planned to accommodate a wide variety of activity. The Resource Center will be the site of the Greater Refuge Temple Church’s community service activity, which includes academic tutoring; teaching Spanish language; teenage and youth counseling; day care; employment preparation; and computer training. It will also offer a place for receptions and events.
“It is always great to cut the ribbon on a finished project – one that will soon be filled with the energy of people – as we are doing here today at this Resource Center,” said
Rural Development
State Director Trina George, who was in attendance at the event. “Please know that USDA Rural Development is proud to be a part of bringing this important center to this community.”
George acknowledged the involvement of the Mississippi’s Congressional delegation, including Senators Thad Cochran and Roger Wicker and Congressman Bennie Thompson, who George said “has long had an interest in making this Center a reality.” George called the Resource Center “truly a bi-partisan effort that has now crossed two Administrations, including that of President Barack Obama, who has demonstrated a great
commitment to rural communities
and to uplifting those in need.”
In addition, the Center represents the fruits of an agency effort to work closely with
faith and community-based organizations
. The non-denominational church has had an accomplished history of community action and service. It seeks to prepare and empower the individual, operating under the slogan: “We will not give you an excuse to fail.” Their success of the past is likely to continue in the new community center.
For more information about available Community Facilities funding, contact any
USDA Rural Development office
.
The Center is a state-of-the-art multi-purpose building that will help Greater Refuge deliver its wide array of community and individual services.
