What is TDM?
TDM is Transportation Demand Management
Transportation Demand Management is the use of strategies to inform and encourage people to maximize the efficiency of our transportation systems; leading to improved mobility, reduced congestion, and lower carbon emissions.  TDM strategies are deployed by public and private sector organizations dedicated to providing a better journey for everyone.
