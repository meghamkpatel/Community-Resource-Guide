MISSION STATEMENT
"to increase the number of culturally responsible black engineers who excel academically, succeed professionally and positively impact the community."
NSBE50 Recap
Exceeding the attendance goal by more than 3,000 participants was only one of many causes for celebration by the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) at its 50th Annual Convention (#NSBE50), in March. More than 18,000 collegiate and K–12 students; STEM-educated professionals; corporate, government and nonprofit recruiters and executives; local and regional community leaders; local government officials, including Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, who is an engineer and a former member of NSBE; and others, gathered for the convention at the Georgia World Congress Center, in Atlanta, March 20–24, 2024 — making it the largest event by attendance in NSBE’s 49-year history, by a wide margin.

Student Loan Stay In The Know
NSBE MEMBERS: this is important info for our community to stay in the know! This post outlines some of the proposed plans the Biden-Harris Administration is pursuing regarding student loan debt relief. In total, these plans would fully eliminate accrued interest for 23 million borrowers, would cancel the full amount of student debt for over 4 million borrowers, and provide more than 10 million borrowers with at least $5,000 in debt relief or more.

NSBE Affirmative Action Statement
NSBE Family,
Last week’s long-anticipated decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to end the use of race as a factor in college and university admissions was a clear step backward in the long struggle toward racial equity and social justice in this country. The damage caused by this ruling will be deep and far-reaching, without question: boosting the growth of barriers to higher education that Black and other BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) communities have faced for centuries, perpetuating racial and ethnic ignorance among students on predominantly white college and university campuses and increasing the destructive polarization now consuming this nation. We have advanced only to once again be forced backward.
