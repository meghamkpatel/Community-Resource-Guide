WELCOME TO
the HUB FARM
The Hub Farm is a 30-acre farm, forest, and aquatic educational center in Durham, North Carolina.
We engage students, teachers, and the Durham Public Schools community in field trips, internships, summer camp, workshops, public events, and more. Our diverse community network and strong institutional partnerships leverage the physical resources on the farm for the benefit of Durham’s students.
Our mission is to engage the Durham Public School community in meaningful outdoor experiences.
We do this through environmental education, community engagement events, and capacity building for outdoor learning across Durham Public Schools.
