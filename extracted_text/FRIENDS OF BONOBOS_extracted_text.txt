We save bonobos and their rainforest home.
JOIN US
Bonobos could go extinct in our lifetime. We're on a mission to stop that.
Bonobos are unique
These great apes are peaceful, cooperative, and kind. In bonobo society, females are in charge.
We share 98.7% of our DNA with them and in many ways, they represent the best side of human nature.

What we do
​We have a comprehensive and long-term approach to bonobo conservation.
We provide rescue, sanctuary and rewilding to endangered bonobos. We save rainforest where bonobos live. We work with communities and government to tackle the root causes of bonobo endangerment. We educate and raise awareness for bonobos and their plight locally and globally.
Rescue & Sanctuary
At Lola ya Bonobo sanctuary, orphaned bonobos are rescued from the illegal trade in wildlife. Bonobos are nursed back to health and cared for as long as needed, sometimes for the rest of their lives.
LEARN MORE
Rewild & Protect
At Ekolo ya Bonobo Community Reserve, bonobos are released back into the wild and given long-term protection. We conserve their rainforest home and work with local communities to lessen poverty and raise bonobo awareness.
LEARN MORE
Tackle Root Causes
The bushmeat trade is tied to extreme poverty. We help communities build a better future through conservation instead of hunting. We educate people about bonobos and their plight within the DRC and globally.
