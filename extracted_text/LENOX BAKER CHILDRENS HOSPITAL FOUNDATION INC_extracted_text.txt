About Me
Media caption for about me section.
I was originally encouraged by my mother, a labor and delivery nurse, to pursue a career in medicine. I became a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon because it is a challenging surgical specialty that requires a lot of thought when making decisions, and because the population is near and dear to my heart. I take care of children with special orthopaedic needs, including scoliosis and other spine disorders, as well as children with growth abnormalities. I also see pediatric trauma patients, meaning children who need orthopaedic surgery due to an accident or other injury. I am inspired by a child's ability to overcome adversity and to adapt to their circumstances, and I find deep gratification when I am able to help improve their lives in some way.
