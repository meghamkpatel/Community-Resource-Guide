New Vista Learning Center
Engaging, Personal, Online New Thought Spiritual Explorations
Greetings. I’m Rev Pat.
New Vista Learning Center is an online meeting space to explore the Universal Truth about all of us:
‘We are spiritual beings, having a human experience.’*
(*Pierre Teilhard de Chardin)
As I became aware of this fundamental reality, I consciously affirm and intend to live with a perpetual awareness of being fully human and divine. It's a radical idea, but there is a growing number of people who are awakening to this universal truth.
Spiritual Exploration courses
April-June 2024:
Overview of Hebrew Scriptures
Overview Christian Scriptures
Metaphysical Interpretation of both Hebrew and Christian Scriptures.
Do you want to explore your understanding of the Divine Self that you are? All courses are open to anyone who wants to explore their understanding of “God” and “Self” in a spiritual, non-dogmatic way in an inclusive, diverse safe space. (Part of the Unity curriculum)

At New Vista Learning Center, we open each session with a centering meditation that creates an intentional atmosphere for safe spiritual discussions.
No ideas are discounted. All spiritual expressions are honored.
Taking it on the Road
I’m taking my ministry on the road this Spring and Summer, maybe into the Fall. I will continue offering online classes regularly, but it will be from different places!
I’m ruthlessly purging all the “stuff” I’ve accumulated. I’ll store a few irreplaceable items, and release my home. At the end of February, I will begin traveling solo (mostly in my Prius) for my 70th year around the sun!

Evolution in the Bible: An Integral Overview of the Hebrew Scriptures
by Rev Pat Veenema, MDiv,
founder of New Vista Learning Center
In this book, I invite you to make sense of the God of the Old Testament and the God of today. I invite you to make peace with the God of the Old Testament while honoring the ancients. I invite you to release the dogma of religion, evolve your perception of God and awaken to an integral understanding of the inevitable and necessary stages of collective and individual consciousness of humanity.
