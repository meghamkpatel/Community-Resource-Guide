InStepp, Inc.
InStepp not only gave me the training I needed to get a job, the program also helped me to build better relationships with my family.
I know of no other similar resources in the community that offer this type of one-on-one long-term assistance.
InStepp helped me see more clearly what and how to get what I wanted out of life.
