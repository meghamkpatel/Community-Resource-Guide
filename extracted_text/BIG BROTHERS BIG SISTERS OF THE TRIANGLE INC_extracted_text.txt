Are you ready to roll for a cause?
Join our community of support today by being part of Bowl for Kids’ Sake 2024.
Bowl For Kids’ Sake is our signature fundraiser that engages the entire Triangle community — neighbors, Bigs/Littles, parents, corporations, co-workers, and families — in raising funds to support our mission. Join a team or become a donor. By supporting Bowl for Kids’ Sake, you defend the power and promise of our youth. Each individual will have an opportunity to create or join a team and join us in bowling for kids.
Our fundraising campaign culminates with the Bowl For Kids’ Sake celebration bowling party on Saturday, April 20, 2024 at Bowlero (formerly AMF South Hills). No bowling expertise is required. Some teams create competitions. Some come just to have fun. And some teams may wish to fundraise but not bowl.
Ready to make a difference? Start your journey by visiting our Bowl For Kids’ Sake page

and ignite the spirit of giving!
