A Word from the Board
Greetings from the AK Foundation Board of Directors.  The AK Foundation was established in 2011 with the mission to honor the legacy of Dr. James E. Shepard through philanthropy and service.
Dr. Shepard was a visionary who founded North Carolina Central University (NCCU) in 1910 and also established the Alpha Kappa Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi in 1931. His efforts resulted in untold opportunities for higher education, training and service, that have positively impacted multiple generations of graduates and our families.
In 2018, the AK Foundation established the Alpha Kappa Endowment Fund at NCCU to provide scholarships for NCCU students so that they too can have a more significant impact on the communities where they  live and work.  The endowment goal is set at $250,000 and our vision is to retire this inaugural commitment in 2022.  In addition, we plan to raise funds via future AK Foundation campaigns to support and supplement other initiatives for NCCU.
The AK Foundation Board is honored to have this opportunity to serve our Alma Mater in this capacity.  We are fully committed to the Foundationâs purpose and you can count on us to be fiscally responsible for this organization, act in accordance with our bylaws and policies and provide our financial support.
