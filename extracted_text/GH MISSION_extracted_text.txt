GH MISSION VALLEY IS NOW OPEN!
GH MISSION VALLEY IS NOW OPEN!
GH MISSION VALLEY IS NOW OPEN!
FOR EVERYONE
GRAVITY HEIGHTS IS
Gravity Heights was born out of a chance encounter between a few passionate and like-minded people having had one (or two) beers too many. We bonded over our belief that using good ingredients and good techniques with the right team will create great food (and beer, oddly enough).
With locations in Sorrento Mesa and Mission Valley, our brewpubs feature a full-service restaurant, epic event space, and expansive outdoor seating. There’s plenty of space for the kids, pups—or adults, no judging—to enjoy the space to the fullest. Open to walk-ins and reservations
Our second location is now open in Mission Valley!

BEYOND THE BEER
You will love our expansive drinks menu that features curated and expertly made cocktails… But back to the beer, Gravity Heights San Diego offers a rotating beer list of 20 local, domestic and imported options. Our own brewed creations are always changing, so just ask your server what GH beer is on tap! Our beer program is led by legendary local brewmaster Skip Virgilio.

OUR EPIC MENU
We will serve you up an unforgettable meal. Gravity Heights was built upon the same foundation as our other concepts including Whisknladle and Catania under the expertise of  partner and culinary director, Chef Ryan Johnston.
