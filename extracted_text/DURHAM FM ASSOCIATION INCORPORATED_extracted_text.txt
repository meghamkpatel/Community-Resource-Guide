May 7 Meeting
What: The  DFMA Meeting
When: Tuesday, May 7th, 6pm to eat, 7pm meeting
Where: Bullock's Barbecue  (once inside, head for the big room to the left)
Program: Auxcomm. Basic Understanding!
Jose Guzman, KD4JWF
Jose will present on Auxcomm,
to help us understand what it is.
If youve considered getting into
public service using amateur radio, this will give you
some insights. Come up with some questions,
because this will be a discussion as well as a
presentation.
Jose has been a ham for a long time (who else do you
know whose call begins with KD4?)
Hes also been in public service for a long time. When
I first met him through OCRA in the late 90s, he was
with the Chapel Hill Police Department. He now lives
in Oxford, still very much involved with emergency
communication. Come join us Tuesday for what
promises to be a very interesting program.

When: Tuesday, April 2nd, 6pm to eat, 7pm meeting
Where: Bullock's Barbecue  (once inside, head for the big room to the left)
Program: TBA
By: TBA
OK, as of press time, the program for Tuesday has not been set.
Its not on April 1st but on the 2nd, but something may come
along at the last minute. But dont despair;  this will still
be a great meeting.
If you have some show and tell to bring, please do so.  If no
formal program develops, it will be fun to see interesting
objects or to hear about individual projects.  I have a video
and some slides in reserve that will also entertain.

Program: Hallicrafters SX-88 Restoration
By: John Green, KX4P
John writes: Hallicrafters radios
were very popular throughout
WW II and among short wave listeners (SWL) and
amateur radio operators for many years afterwards.
A large majority of hams grew up having one or more
of their many models produced. Their "top of the
line" receiver was produced in limited numbers and
for a very short time.
Bob Dennison and a crew made the first dedicated
island DXpedition to Clipperton Island in 1954. After
many mishaps they finally landed with two of the
eighty-pound each SX-88 radios and other
equipment. They made 1,108 QSOs!
John will give a PowerPoint presentation showing the
restoration (with the help of several critical friends)
and operation of an SX-88 he acquired.
John has presented several great programs at our
previous meetings. He presentations always shine
and should not be missed.
Join us on Tuesday!

Program: Up, Up & Away  Balloons and APRS
By: Daniel DeCourt, W3WDD
Daniel has been involved with the
launch and tracking of helium-filled
balloons from western North Carolina. The
balloons transmit on 144.39 with APRS tracking
which is available on the website aprs.fi . Previous
balloons have traveled beyond Charlotte or western
South Carolina. The website shows altitude and
speed of the balloon. Coordination with the FAA is
required and on the last flight, air traffic control at
the Charlotte airport got excited about the balloon
in their airspace. Daniel lives in Dillsboro and will be
making the trip to Durham to give us the program.
I hope you will be able to join us on Tuesday!

By: Mark Eagle
Mark will be talking about the
new ATSC 3.0 system that is
coming to improve our television
experience as well as other things related to the
internet and other systems that we use. He recently
retired from Spectrum (formerly Time Warner) after

When: Tuesday, December 5th, 6pm
Where: Bullock's Barbecue
Program:
The DFMA Christmas Party
Continuing a tradition of having the DFMA pick up the club member's tab
for our December Holiday Dinner Meeting, we will meet at Bullock's
Barbecue Restaurant in Durham starting around 6:00pm. You will be able
to order from the menu.  Each member may also bring one guest. Bring
your spouse or friend! (As you know, normally our meetings are open to
all.  Because the club is footing the bill, it is restricted to members.)
There will be no program as such. However, be ready to relate, very briefly,
your accomplishments in the past year, mostly with respect to ham radio. 
(In past years we've solicited ham new year's resolutions.  This year we'd
like to hear what you've actually accomplished.)
We will be collecting donations of toys (new, unwrapped) to forward to the
Toys for Tots program (sponsored by the US Marine Corps Reserve).  We will 
also
pass the hat for donations to Urban Ministries of Durham and The
Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina. All gifts are, of course, 
optional.  Don't skip this celebration just because money is tight this
year.

Program: Seeing the Invisible Universe
By: John Green, KX4P
Recently, at the invitation of a ham radio friend, John attended
the annual conference of the Society of Amateur Radio Astronomers.
It was located at the Green Bank Radio Observatory in West Virginia.
This facility is a major center for radio astronomy studies. It is
also the home for the world's largest fully steerable radio
telescope, i.e., 500-foot diameter parabolic dish antenna. The
program will describe the trip, brief history of radio astronomy,
the speakers, activities, and trip to the top of antenna.
John has been a DFMA member for many years. He is an excellent
speaker and has presented several DFMA programs in the past. This
is really one you shouldnt miss

Program: P25 - the Basis of Interoperability
By: Chris Ferrer, KY4OU
Chris' presentation will outlines what P25 is, why it was developed
and why its so important. He will also try to provide a live
demonstration utilizing the W4BAD P25 repeater located in downtown Durham.
Communications is the heart of our hobby. If you've
dealt with modern scanners, you've probably seen
reference P25 before. Here's you chance to
bring your knowledge up-to-date. Don't miss this
one.

By: Chip Blach, KF4WBK
Chip will lead us through several ways to get help in emergencies.
While not using repeaters and other ham gear he will prepare
you for ways to protect yourself in case you have
emergencies off the beaten path. I think youll find
this a very interesting program.
Chip was a DFMA member some decades ago. Then
work moved him around. He reports: I have been a
long time Ham operator for 30 years and just moved
back to NC from Colorado..

Program: Intro to FT8
By: Dee Ramm, KU4GC
I will present an overview of the increasingly popular
FT-8 digital mode. After a brief history of the
software and its originator, Joe Taylor, K1JT, I will
explain what it is - what it can and cant do. Then Ill
deal with how I set up my HF station to take
advantage of this great system. This will include the
configuration of the software.
I will also go over screen shots of actual sessions and
explain the user interface and options available. All
will be based on my actual experience.

Program:
Building Simple Wire Antennas
By: Dee Ramm, KU4GC
With a tight budget, ham radio can present a real challenge.  One of the few areas in which a ham can still  DIY is in building antennas. For the beginner, simple wire antennas are a good place to start.  I started down this path in 1997 and have some actual experience to relate and am still using some of these antennas today.  I will begin with the simple dipole - an essentially single band antenna. Doing that right covers all of the basics. Going for more than one band might then be solved by putting up multiple dipoles.
This leads naturally to the fan dipole. There you cover multiple band with one feed line.  I will emphasize practical issues and simple solutions. There are two prerequisites.  You do have to have some trees and a bit of real estate.
I hope you will be able to join us!

Program:
Introduction to the Cell Phone System
By: Charlie Durst. NC4CD
Many of us can remember the days
when the idea that everyone
would have their own phone
sounded like a science fiction
fantasy - just short of impossible. Charlie will review
the trip from then until the present. He will give us
some technical insights and explain the levels of
service that weve come through. In other words hell
answer questions like what were the levels and what
did the G numbers imply. What is G5? When sitting
in adjacent rooms and talking to each other on cell
phones, where does the information flow? I expect
well all learn a lot.
Charlie retired from the telephone industry many
years ago and now is involved with providing tower
services for the phone industry, among others. He is
a co-founder of the DFMA and has been our Repeater
Manager for decades.

Introduction to APRS
By: Sam Tannous, KJ4VWG
Automatic Packet Reporting
System (APRS) is an amateur radio-based system for real time
digital communications of information of immediate value in
the local area. Data can include object GPS coordinates, weather
station telemetry, email, SMS, text messages, announcements,
queries, and other telemetry. APRS data can be
displayed on a map, which can show stations, objects,
tracks of moving objects, weather stations, search
and rescue data, and direction finding data.
Sam is a long time DFMA member and helps maintain
the local APRS support
infrastructure.

Max Bloodworth, KO4TV, sk
August 12, 1933  February 18, 2023
Glenn Max Bloodworth, 89, passed away on Saturday,
February 18, 2023. He was born in York County,
South Carolina, to the late Glenn Memory Bloodworth
and Mary Emily Dendy Bloodworth. He retired as the
Chief Radio Engineer for the North Carolina Highway
Patrol. He was active in amateur radio and had an
amateur extra ticket. In addition to his parents, he is
preceded in death by his wife of over 50 years, Ruth
Bloodworth (KE4DRI) and his sister, Mary Hodge. He
is survived by his children, Linda Bloodworth and
Michael Bloodworth (Valerie); sister, Etta Marie
Presley; grandsons, William Bloodworth and Bryan
Bloodworth (Beth) and great-grandson, Blake
Bloodworth. He did not want a service.
Max and Ruth were long time members of the DFMA
until he moved to Archer Lodge (south of Wendell in
northern Johnston County). They and their daughter,
Linda were regular meeting attendees. Max was
particularly active in encouraging antenna building
projects. I still have a J-Pole antenna that I received
at one of my first DFMA meetings. Over the years he
did several programs and also wrote a series of
articles on amateur radio antennas for The Link.
(Youll find  reprints of most of these in recent editions of The Link.) He even
built his own screwdriver antenna for mobile HF use
from scratch.
In later years I sometimes saw him at JARSfest in
Benson. There I bought several of his cleverly
designed J-pole antennas made with stainless steel
whips and parts of power strips as spacers. One of
these is still on the bumper of Lenores (KF4PAB) old
van. The other is sitting behind me right now as my
indoor VHF, UHF antenna. Max was a very
interesting person to talk to and very knowledgeable.
He has been missed by the DFMA for some time and,
Im sure, by others lucky enough to get to know him.

the website of Strickland Funeral Home & Crematory,
211 W. Third St., Wendell, NC)

Larry Stowell, K1ZW, sk
Just before our last club meeting, we heard that Larry
had passed away and we announced that at the
meeting. We have still not seen any additional
information. Larry and his wife Kathleen (KA2SBC)
were long-time DFMA members. However, Larry
hardly ever attended meetings, so many of you
probably never met him. 
Larry did frequent our hamfests. Our
condolences to Kathleen and family

The Making of a Mobile Ham Station
By: Chris Bindrim, KE7GZG
Chris will present on creating a mobile
ham station with coverage from 1.8 -
1200 MHz. He will explain his choices
and notes: "Everything is a Compromise"
First licensed in 1982, Chris holds an extra class
license. He moved to Durham in October of last year
and recently joined the DFMA. He loves building and
experimenting.
For the newer ham, this is a "must see" program.
And, for the old-timers, you can still learn new tricks.

those already familiar with DMR and
new info for everyone else. DMR is
growing rapidly and new things have
happened since DFMA put a DMR
repeater up at Hillsborough. Radio
prices have come down and more
features are available in HTs and mobiles.
As most of you already know, Charlie is an excellent
speaker, so its sure to be a rewarding talk. If youve
been considering taking the (not so big) leap to trying
DMR, heres a chance to get into it.

crash course in receiving weather
imagery from both NOAA and GOES
satellites. There will be inexpensive and
straightforward options for the
beginner, and jumping off points for
people with intermediate to advanced
technical skills. Receiving weather satellite imagery
does not require an amateur license (since there's no
transmitting), so it's a great project for someone
interested in radio who isn't yet licensed, OR the
seasoned ham who wants to get deeper into digital
signal processing, Raspberry Pi, and homebrew
antennas.

Alan Knight (AA4FU) an IBM Senior Engineer, will do a presentation on IBM
Worldwide EMC-EMI compliance testing
done at IBMs Research Triangle Park Facility. EMCEMI
testing is critical to the design and production of
electronic equipment. Regulatory agencies, including
the FCC, have set specific emissions limits for an
electronic device. These EMC regulations aim to
provide improved reliability and safety for the user
and absence of interference to other equipment.
Failing to pass EMC compliance tests can result in
delays, fines and recalls.

DurHamFest Canceled or Postponed
At The DFMA Board meeting last Tuesday, it was
decided that DurHamFest 2022 will not happen this
spring. The facility at the Durham Public School Staff
Development Center is no longer available. We are
looking for a new venue, but time has run out for
doing this in May. Also, after attending RARSfest, it
looks like some of the vendors that have served us as
"anchors" are either out of business already or are in
the process of shutting down. So, we will also be
looking for new vendors. Their broad range of
offerings of stuff that many hams come to a hamfest
for are important to our success. Of course, we will
continue to support club tables, and individuals who
feel tables are the best for displaying their offerings.
Tail gating will also be encouraged to make our
hamfest as worthwhile as in previous years.

January 4 Meeting - DFMA Meeting on the Air - HAPPY NEW YEAR
Program: Grounding and
Lightning Protection of Towers and
Radio Equipment.
As you've noticed, we've taken a step
backwards and
will NOT be at Bullock's
but
are meeting on the repeaters (145.450- PL 82.5) again.
However we will have an excellent
program.
The program should
be very timely and an excellent introduction for our
newer members and a good reminder for the oldtimers.
Our Repeater Manager, Charlie, NC4CD, who has
loads of practical experience in this area will present on the air.
Some of the topics he will cover
are:
- Why and how do you ground your tower, antennas,
and station equipment?
- How to construct an effective ground system for
your tower and antennas.
- How is ground resistance measured? What are the
objectives ?
- How to connect all your equipment to the ground
system.
- What to do when a thunderstorm is coming.
- What do we do at a repeater site during a
thunderstorm? You cant go disconnect all the
antennas!
This meeting should be extremely interesting.
I hope you will be able to join us!

December Meeting - The DFMA Christmas Party
What: See title.
When: Tuesday, December 7th, 6pm
Where: Bullock's Barbecue!!  (once inside, head for the big room to the left)
What else: Good food.  Good cheer.  Your fellow hams.
Continuing a tradition of having the DFMA pick up the tab for members at our December Christmas Dinner Meeting, we will meet at Bullock's Barbecue Restaurant in Durham starting at 6:00pm. You will be able to order from the menu.  This meeting is for paid-up members and each member can bring one guest -- bring your spouse or friend!
(For the safety of all attendees, we ask that you give this a pass if you have not been able to get vaccinated.  Last meeting we had, and for future meetings we plan to have, an outgoing video feed of  the program with a live chat for all unable to physically attend.  Since there is no program as such, we will not be generating streaming video of this meeting.)
This is our Christmas Meeting -- In that spirit and tradition you may (optionally):
+++
Bring a new Christmas gift to be distributed to needy children through Toys for Tots. If wrapped, mark gender and age range on the outside. If not wrapped, that's fine too. If you have one -- a gift bag would work too.
+++
The Club will make its annual donation, splitting it between the Urban Ministries of Durham and the Food Bank of  Eastern and Central North Carolina. We will be passing the hat" for personal contributions.  Cash contributions will also be split between the two organizations.
In past years some people have dropped a check in the hat. You can make it out to any charity you like. We can forward it and the canceled check can be handy at tax time.
But, if you are not in a position to donate anything this year, please come anyway. Or if you are making a special effort through your church or at the office, dont feel pressured to do more than you really should. Your presence at this dinner is a gift to all of us.
Your Ham New Years Resolution
Another traditional feature of our Christmas Party is the making of a Ham New Years Resolution. So, one thing well do is go around to everyone and, if you made a resolution last year, well read it to the group and you can report on how you did. Then, you can make a resolution for next year. And, it can be a lot of fun for all.  Its easy to make a joke of this and I guess thats OK. However, I urge you to come up with well thought out ham-related goals for yourself. Set yourself some fairly realistic goals and see if you can achieve them. Of course, each year we have a lot of misses from last year but that can be reality check and a lot of fun for all.
But as last year, I urge you to think about some goals for the DFMA as well. Feel free to voice them when you make a resolution for yourself. Or, let the Board members know if there are things we could improve. Better yet, get involved and volunteer to help us meet those goals.  The DFMAs success depends on your involvement and help in the future. Its your move.

Bill Sims, W4AK, sk
The program at our first in-person meeting of the DFMA was a summary of the history of our repeaters.  I presented this program as I was one of the charter members of DFMA.  I mentioned that when I moved to Durham in 1970, there was a repeater in Durham on 146.34-146.94.   It was owned and operated by Bill Sims, K4RUQ.  The 146.34 receiver was at his house in Parkwood.  He used a 440 MHz. radio link to the 146.94 transmitter on TV Hill in north Durham.  This split-site repeater did not require a duplexer which was very expensive, even in 1970.  Bill used tube type radios made by Motorola, General Electric, Dumont, and others.  These were retired from commercial two way radio service and were relatively cheap.
Bill was a bit cantankerous with the users of his repeater.  It seemed as if he monitored it 24 hours a day.  He would frequently interject his comments  into conversations.  Annoyingly, one could kerchunk the repeater at midnight or 3 am, and he would instantly say you got it, talk on it.  In the early 70s, most converted Motorola or GE radios had only one or two channels.  Most radios were on 34-94 for repeaters and 146.52 for simplex.  To minimize key-ups from nearby 34-94 users, Bill implemented a system called whistle-up for access to his repeater.  To use his repeater, one had to whistle into the mike (increasing the frequency like trying to call the dog) and hoping to hit the frequency of the decoder.  When his repeater was whistled up, it stayed available for a conversation.
After a while I decided that Durham needed a ham club with its own repeater.  Thirteen hams attended the first meeting and the DFMA was formed.  Bill did not attend.  A repeater on 449.1-444.1 was DFMAs first repeater.  After 50 years, DFMA has 100 members and 7 repeaters at 3 sites: Hillsborough, the Durham VA Hospital, and TV Hill.  Our current TV Hill tower is on land adjacent to Bills original 146.94 transmitter site.
The week following our DFMA meeting, I saw the obituary for Bill.  He died on October 4, 2021 at the age of 89.     W4AK (formerly K4RUQ)  SK.  73 Bill.

New FCC Rules on RF Safety in Amateur Radio
By: Chuck Till, KF4RGN
Most of you have likely read about the
new rules requiring hams to evaluate
their home station for RF safety. Chuck's
presentation should give you a nice assist
to meeting those requirements.
Chuck, K4RGN was first licensed in 1970.
He has a Bachelor's and a Master's in
Electrical Engineering from Georgia Tech.
Prior to retirement, he worked in
international marketing for telecom
companies. His main interests in ham
radio are digital modes. He's also a
volunteer announcer at WCPE The
Classical Station 89.7.
Unfortunately, we won't be getting together in person for our September
meeting as planned. Instead, we'll use the streaming configuration we 
used last month. This time though, the live video part will be limited
to the president and me, and everyone else will be able to participate
by watching a live video stream and adding your comments to the web chat.

June 14 Special NASA Presentation vi Zoom
Co-sponsored by OCRA and DFMA
A joint OCRA/DFMA sponsored program by NASA is being offered on Monday, June
14th at 7:30pm. The NASA presentation will be on the Zoom video platform with
details to be published later.
There will actually be two presentations.
One of the  speakers is Al Feinberg, the Strategic Content and Media
Advisor for NASA Space Communications & NASA Television Headquarters in
Washington, D.C.  His presentation will be on Space Communications in Support of NASA
The other speaker is Rosalie White, K1STO,  ARRISS (Amateur Radio on the International Space Station) US Delegate. Her 
 presentation will be Celebrating 20 Years of Continuous Amateur Radio Operations on the ISS.

 Some of you may remember the space station
communication from the Phillips Middle School in Chapel Hill.  That happened
almost 20 years ago and was quite a media event.  The teacher of the class
involved, Barbara
Pederson, KE4JZM, had an HF station in her classroom. (Barbara was also active
in the Civil Air Patrol.)
Watch the OCRA-DFMA@groups.io mailing list for additional
information.  The latest information will also be placed on the this website
and there will probably be a direct mailing to DFMA members just before the
event.
Many thanks to the presenters.  Also, special thanks goes to Wilson, W4BOH,
for arranging this program and to Dan, KR4UB, who is doing much of the
logistical support and making sure that Zoom help is available to anyone
that needs it.

May 10 Special NASA Presentation Canceled
In both the May Link and in the cover note we announced that there would be a special program on space communications originating with NASA.  This was being sponsored by both OCRA and the DFMA and was scheduled during OCRA's regular monthly meeting slot - Monday, 5/10 at 7:30pm.
Unfortunately Donna Ruth Green, the wife of John Green, KX4P, passed away a few days ago. The visitation at the Donaldson Funeral Home in Pittsboro has been scheduled for Monday at 6-8pm and a number of our members would like to attend.  Therefore it was felt best to cancel the special program and the abbreviated on-line OCRA monthly meeting that was to meet at 7pm.
Our condolences to John (who is a member of both clubs and who has
presented some excellent programs for our meetings) and his family.

Hillsborough, North Carolina - Joanna Marie George, 80, passed away on
Saturday, January 2, 2021 at her home. She was born in Durham, the daughter
of the late Charles Oral Huffer and Sarah Isenhour Huffer. Mrs. George is
predeceased by her husband of 59 years, Dr. Rhett T. George, Jr.
Mrs. George worked at Duke University with the University Research Council.
At Duke, she met Rhett and they married in 1961. Mrs. George retired from
Wilmore Electronics as an Electronic Technician. Together with Rhett, she
helped promote safe boating through the United States Power Squadron. She
was very active in retirement as part of the Orange County Board of
Elections, with the Orange County VITA Tax Program, and especially quilting.
A lifelong artist, she worked in a variety of mediums over the years but
fabric arts was her true passion. She was in the Cherry Creek Lane Quilters,
in the Durham Orange Quilt Guild, and in the Tuesday Donations Quilts Group
at the Passmore Center.
Mrs. George is survived by her son, Charles R. George (Dawn); sister, Susan
Huffer Gay (Curtis); and grandchildren, Caitlin George Kalen (Alex) and
Ashlee George.
The family would like to thank the many people who helped us and prayed for
our family during this difficult time. We especially want to acknowledge the
thoughtful, caring assistance provided from Mrs. George's quilting friends,
Visiting Angels of Carrboro, and staff of Duke HomeCare and Hospice.
A memorial service will be held at a later date.
In lieu of flowers, the family requests that memorial donations be made to
McMannen United Methodist Church, 4102 Neal Road, Durham NC 27705.
The family is being assisted by Clements Funeral & Cremation Services, Inc.
in Durham. Online condolences may be sent to www.clementsfuneralservice.com.

Joanna, KE4QOZ -- In Appreciation
In January, the ham community lost the other half of the George duo, following Rhetts (KE4HIH) passing   by about a half of a month.  Joanna and Rhett were among the most faithful attendees of our monthly club meetings.  I met Joanna at DFMA meetings soon after I got my ticket in 1997.  Joanna was first licensed in 1994, following Rhett by about a year.  Joanna was active in the club in various ways.  She served a period as DFMA secretary.  She actively supported the club at the annual DurHamFests.  In the last decade or so she managed the DFMA Club Table and tried to make sure that Rhett didnt take home much more than he had brought.  She and Rhett also hosted the DFMAs annual Picnic for many years.  Often that included access to their swimming pool (not to forget Rhetts trains).
In addition, Joanna will be remembered for her many other activities.  She was an avid quilter and had a room at home dedicated to her extra large quilting frame.  For years she worked with the Orange County Board of Elections as a precinct official.  This did mean that Rhett often had to attend the November DFMA meeting alone.   She and Rhett were very active in supporting the U S Power Squadron promoting safe boating.  Joanna was also very active in VITA (Volunteer Income Tax Assistance) for low income clients.
Joanna was an accomplished cook and hostess. In addition to the DFMA Picnic,  she and Rhett annually hosted a Procrastinator's Christmas Party in the following new year.  There were always many interesting guests.  (Parking them on their steep hillside property was Rhetts specialty).  However Joannas coleslaw was eagerly anticipated at the annual Field Day activities.
But, of course, her other major interest was Rhett.  They did many things together.  They even had his and hers electric tractors (vintage GE Electraks employing 6V golf cart style batteries).  And they had fun: you all will probably remember that during self-introductions at meetings Joanna would give her base as Hillsborough while Rhett gave his as Scarletts Ridge.
