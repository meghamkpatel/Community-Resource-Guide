FINDING THE WAY HOME
Learn More
Right here in Durham, there are families who need our help. Families without a place to live. Families with young children. Families in need.
Working together, we help provide families with children a stable, safe, and loving environment while they are in the temporary crisis of homelessness. FMF now offers after-school tutoring, educational enrichment programming, and early interventions to children residing in our shelter as part of a multi-generation approach that aims to break the cycle of poverty in our community.
Thanks to the ongoing teamwork of loving volunteers and professional staff, our families become self-reliant members of the community who can then give back to others in need.
