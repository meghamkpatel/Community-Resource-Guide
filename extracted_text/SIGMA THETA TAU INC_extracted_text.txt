I’ve found when teams learn the principles and practice applied improvisational exercises, they enhance their communication skills and develop more creativity and problem-solving abilities.

I initially pursued the nursing profession due to parental expectations, but, at times, doubted about my suitability. However, a breakthrough my senior year led to a career dedicated to subcultural healthcare.

Lindy Finch has wanted to help people her entire life. When it was her family who needed the help, the kindness, reassurance, and empathy shown by St. Judes' nurses had a profound impact on her—so much so that it changed her career path and her life.

Salima Siraj, MN, BScN, is inspired each day by the profound impact nurses have on patients’ lives. It’s why she became a nurse. “The opportunity to make a difference and the rewarding nature of the profession drew me in,” she
    says.
She joined the Mu Sigma Chapter recently with the help of an Edith Anderson Membership Subsidy. It was important for her to join Sigma to broaden her network, gain diverse perspectives, have access to ongoing research, and take advantage of opportunities to attend conferences. Salima says that the financial assistance to become a Sigma member has helped her make meaningful connections through mentorship programs and has enabled her to engage with her chapter’s vibrant community. She says, “This support has not only accelerated my career development but has also positioned me for greater success within my field.”
Her patients’ prayers inspire her every day to continue her work. She is also motivated by changing perceptions of nurses and nursing. Before becoming a nurse, Salima was bothered by portrayals of nursing in the media. She wants to be “an agent of change” and work to reshape common misperceptions of nurses and improve the healthcare system.
As a recent graduate, she has advice for those still in school: “Stay resilient, challenge stereotypes, and embrace the rewarding aspects of nursing.” And maybe her ways of coping with the tough days can also help. Salima likes to practice gratitude through journaling to manage stress and regain perspective. Spending time with loved ones also helps her navigate challenges.
The
Edith Anderson Membership Subsidy
is made possible by donations to the Sigma Foundation for Nursing.
