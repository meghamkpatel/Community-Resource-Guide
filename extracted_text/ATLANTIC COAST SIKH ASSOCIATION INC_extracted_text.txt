Sikh communities in or around Durham, North Carolina?
Question
We’re planning to move to USA from India in Spring.
Me, My Wife and our Daughter of 6 months.
Moving to an entirely new country seems so overwhelming. Especially with a child and stay at home wife (due to visa issues). We really need a safe and sound neighbourhood where I can be assured about my family’s safety when away at work.
Does anyone know any area with some significant sikh population and or around Durhan, NC?
A quick look up shows a Gurudwara Sahib in the city, eventually planning to visit there for leads after reaching USA.
