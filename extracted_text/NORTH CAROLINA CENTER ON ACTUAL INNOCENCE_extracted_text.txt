on Abdul Rasheed – Free, but his chance for justice was destroyed
Between December 1998 and January 1999, three armed robberies occurred at restaurants in Durham  located relatively close to one another, and similarities in the robberies indicated that they were committed by the same person. A month later, a victim from the robberies picked Abdul Rasheed’s picture out of a mug book.
