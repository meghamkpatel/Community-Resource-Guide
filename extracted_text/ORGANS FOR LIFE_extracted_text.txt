Organ, Eye & Tissue Donation FAQs
Who can be a donor?
People of all ages and medical histories should consider themselves potential donors. Your medical condition at the time of death will determine what organs and tissues can be donated.
A national system matches available organs from the donor with people on the waiting list based on blood type, body size, how sick they are, donor distance, tissue type and time on the list. Sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression, race, income, celebrity and social status are never considered.
How does the deceased donation process work?
Deceased donation is the process of giving organs, corneas or tissues at the time of the donor’s death for the purpose of transplantation. Deceased donation can only occur after death has been declared by medical professionals who are not part of the donation and transplant process.
The state donor registry and National Donate Life Registry are searched securely online to determine if the patient has authorized donation. If the potential donor is not found in a registry, their next of kin or legally authorized representative is offered the opportunity to authorize the donation. Donation and transplantation professionals follow national policy to determine which organs can be transplanted and to which patients on the national transplant waiting list the organs are to be allocated.
Read more about the deceased donation process.
Is there a cost to be an organ, eye and tissue donor?
There is no cost to the donor’s family or estate for donation. The donor family pays only for medical expenses before death and costs associated with funeral arrangements.
How do I know if I'm already registered?
If you registered in the National Donate Life Registry on DonateLife.net, RegisterMe.org, or in your iPhone Health App, please go to
RegisterMe.org
and click “Access Your Registration” to make changes to your donor registration record.
If you registered through your DMV or Driver License Partner, you should have a heart or other symbol on your license. If you need to confirm or change your state registration, please reach out to your local contact.

.
Does registering as a donor change my patient care?
Your life always comes first. Doctors work hard to save every patient’s life, but sometimes there is a complete and irreversible loss of brain function. The patient is declared clinically and legally dead. Only then is donation an option.
I want to learn more about living donation. Where should I look?
Living organ donation offers another choice for some transplant candidates, reducing their time on the waiting list and leading to better long term outcomes for the recipient. Living tissue donation, birth tissue, is used to promote healing and to treat burns and painful wounds.

In memory of
My Liver Donor
Today is the one-year anniversary of my liver transplant. Today is also the one-year anniversary of me receiving the most precious gift I’ll ever be given. To the donor of my new liver, I’ll never have the pleasure of knowing you but I promise to spend each and every day of my life honoring you and making the most out of this second chance I’ve been given. I can never properly express the gratitude I have in my heart, but I’ll try every day to pass that gratitude along to others and to help make this world brighter. I hope to make your family proud with my actions and to live life with compassion and care. April 28 will forever be the most important day in my life.
