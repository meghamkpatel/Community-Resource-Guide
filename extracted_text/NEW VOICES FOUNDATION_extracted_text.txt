WHY NEW VOICES?
Women of color entrepreneurs are the fastest growing segment of entrepreneurs in the United States but they don’t enjoy the same access to capital and other resources as their male and female counterparts. In fact, businesses owned by African-American and Latina women receive less than one percent of all venture capital funding every year.

IMPACT
New Voices Foundation has invested more than $2.62 million in non-dilutive capital and matched support dollars in companies owned by women of color, hosted eighteen pitch competitions for women of color entrepreneurs at
EssenceFest
,
CES
and other leading national and regional events, and provided hundreds of coaching and mentorship hours to these entrepreneurs.
