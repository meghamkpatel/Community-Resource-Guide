Who We Are
Trinity Life Church is a non-denominational church plant, comprised of people who follow the way of Jesus and want Him to be known in Durham, NC and the rest of the world. We believe in the truth of the Bible and strive to live out our faith authentically together.
Trinity Life Church reflects the city of Durham, its neighborhoods and its universities with a diverse gathering of people from all stages of life and spiritual development. We are not committed to just one race, age group, or demographic; we want to reach every person with the Gospel and see a healthy, authentic community of believers formed as a result.
We are a community that aims to offer many opportunities for people to grow in their relationship with Jesus, such as small group discipleship in homes (what we call “House Church”) and our Sunday morning worship service.  We are a church that loves people, wants to be fed from God’s Word and is committed to growing and serving in such a way that we become more like Christ.
About 20 adults (and 19 kids!) have been meeting as a House Church since January 2019 to worship God, study His Word, and build biblical community. We currently have grown to about 65 adults and 35 kids.
We currently gather for Sunday worship at 10:30am at ReCity Network (112 Broadway St. Durham, NC 27701) and on YouTube Live. We also meet for House Church (small group gatherings) in homes during the week.  Please check out our Events Page for the most up to date happenings.
