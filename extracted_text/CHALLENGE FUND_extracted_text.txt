Having heard the testimonies of Amal Mohammad Alomar and Iman Faisal Alenaizat, two young Jordanian women now employed at WebHelp, this perception completely shifted. For them, friendship and mutual support became the perfect recipe that helped them navigate common challenges and share achievements and successes once their career kick-started.
