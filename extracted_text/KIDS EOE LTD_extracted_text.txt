Abstract
Background and purpose:
Utilization of complementary medicines (CMs) amongst children with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in Australia is high. Carers' beliefs, perceptions and use of CM can influence the decision to use CM in children in their care. This study explores the factors influencing the use of CM for a child's EoE when the carer also uses CM.
Materials and methods:
Carers of children aged 0-18 years with EoE participated in a national cross-sectional online survey, conducted in Australia between September 2018 and February 2019. Data analysis included bivariate analysis, Cramer's V, backwards stepwise logistic regression and binomial logistic regression.
Results:
Of the 181 total survey responses, 165 (91.2 %) respondents indicated they had utilized some form of CM for themselves. Children whose carer had used some form of CM for themselves were more likely to have used CM than children whose carer had not used CM (OR 4.6; p = 0.001). Of the CM self-using carers, 125 (75.8 %) had also chosen to utilize CM for their child's EoE. Use of CM in children was more likely amongst children who had used a pharmaceutical for their EoE (OR 7.51; p = 0.010), and those whose carer had consulted with "other health practitioners or health workers" for their child's EoE (OR 5.34; p < 0.001) or had consulted with a chiropractor for themselves (OR 2.70; p = 0.029).
Conclusion:
High CM self-use amongst carers is associated with their decision to also use CM for their child's EoE, a concern given the absence of evidence for CM's safety and efficacy in this population. CM use in this population warrants further attention. Effective conventional medicines for EoE are limited and utilization of CM amongst children with EoE in Australia is high. The recommendation of CM for children with EoE warrants further attention given the substantial concomitant pharmaceutical care, and the absence of evidence for CM's safety and efficacy in this population. Further research into the role of CM practitioners, products, and therapies in an integrative model between CM and conventional healthcare must be undertaken.
