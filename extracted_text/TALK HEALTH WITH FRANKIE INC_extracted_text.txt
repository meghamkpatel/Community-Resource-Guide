Your Health Matters
Welcome to Talk Health with Frankie, where healing begins from within. I'm Fransine Sanchez, affectionately known as Coach Frankie, and I am proud to be the founder and president of Talk Health with Frankie Co., Inc., a registered 501(c)3 non-profit organization.
​
At Talk Health with Frankie, our vision is to transform Durham from the city of medicine to the city of health through a holistic medicine approach. Our mission is to provide comprehensive holistic health services to underserved and underrepresented populations. We are dedicated to empowering individuals to heal their minds, bodies, and spirits, fostering wellness from the inside out. Over the past eight years, Talk Health with Frankie Co., Inc. has been actively working to improve the health and well-being of communities in Durham, North Carolina, as well as the Research Triangle Park (RTP) area, with aspirations to extend our impact nationwide.
​
In my role as the Director of Wellness & Quality and Health Coach at Avance Care- Broad Steet formerly known as Durham Family Medicine, I have spent the last 15 years cultivating an environment where collaboration and teamwork drive a culture of health. Through a strategic partnership between Durham Family Medicine and Talk Health with Frankie, we provide health coaching services to a community in need of transformative change. Together, alongside the providers at Avance Care - Broad Street, we adopt a team-based approach to address and reverse lifestyle diseases.
​
My own journey in the field of holistic health led me to attain board certification as a Holistic Health Practitioner from The Holistic Arts Institute. With over 19 years of experience in the medical field, I have delved into numerous dietary theories and practiced various food-based therapies. In addition to my certification as a Holistic Health Practitioner, I hold credentials as a Certified Health Education Specialist and an AFAA-certified group fitness instructor. Furthermore, I am a licensed Zumba, Zumba Kids, and Zumba Kids Jr Instructor.
My educational background includes a Bachelor of Science in Behavioral and Social Sciences from North Carolina Central University, a Master of Public Health with a concentration in Community Health Education, and a post-baccalaureate certificate in Workplace Wellness from the University of North Carolina Greensboro. Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Community Health Education at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, driven by a passion for effecting change on a population level, addressing health disparities, and advocating for social determinants of health.
​
In the words of Maya Angelou, "I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel." At Talk Health with Frankie, we strive to create lasting positive experiences and make a genuine impact on the lives of those we serve.
​
Thank you for joining us on this journey to holistic well-being and health empowerment.
