IANDS Publications
is pleased to announce the publication of Robert Christophor (Bob) Coppes' book
Impressions of Near-Death Experiences
. In this book, Coppes presents many hundreds of quotes from more than 100 experiencers from all over the world. By organizing these excerpts into categories, he gives the reader a more in-depth and nuanced
impression
of the near-death experience (NDE). NDEs
come alive
and this effect multiplies as the reader progresses through the book. The message from these stories will touch a truth that is deep within you—an inner core that you can trust.

Participate in an NDE Research Study!
If you have had a near-death experience (NDE), NDE-like experience or related experience, please consider participating in the on-going research studies below. All of these studies have been reviewed and approved by the
IANDS Academic & Research Committee
.
1. Did Your Near-Death Experience Affect Your Work Life?
Objectives:
Near-death experiences are unusual experiences that sometime occur in people who have been physically or psychologically close to death as a result of, for example, cardiac arrest or an accident. You are invited to voluntarily participate in a study exploring how near-death experiences (NDE) affect people’s work lives, such as their career paths, work goals, and work relationships.
Researcher:
The lead researcher on this study is Dr. Jamie Gruman, a business professor at the
University of Guelph
in Ontario, Canada. Dr. Gruman can be contacted at
This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.
.
Type of study:
Participation involves a single, one-hour interview conducted over Zoom, scheduled at your convenience.
Study ends:
After 30 NDE cases are received.
Further information and contact information
2. The Relationship between Inner Change and Outer Change
Objectives:
The purpose of this study is to make a contribution into this gap by exploring the relationship between inner change (i.e., transformative experiences) and outer change toward sustainability (i.e., how we engage with the larger world). Sustainability is being defined as  conditions which support the flourishing of all life-forms, including the earth.
Researcher:
Elizabeth Halliday, Master of Science programme in Consciousness, Spirituality and Transpersonal Psychology at
Alef Trust
, UK.
Type of study:
Online survey.
Study ends:
August 30, 2024
Further information and contact information
3. Terminal Lucidity in Children and Adults
Objectives:
Terminal Lucidity (TL) is an unexpected surge of mental clarity usually reported in the last minutes, hours, or days before a person’s death. TL remains little understood. Although it is often reported in those of older age who have dementia, anecdotal evidence suggests TL is also very common
in children
who are terminally ill. More research is needed to better understand TL in children and to provide important details regarding the end-of-life stage of children, what the child's and parents/caregivers' needs might be, and how medical personnel can best respond to meet those needs.
Researcher:
Dr. Natasha Tassell-Matamua, Associate Professor at Massey University, Aotearoa, New Zealand.
Type of study:
You are invited to complete an online questionnaire, which will take approximately 30-40 minutes to complete. The questionnaire will ask you questions about the TL episode you witnessed, the circumstances of the passing of the adult
or
child who had the TL episode, as well as the psychological impact of witnessing TL on your spiritual and religious beliefs, attitudes towards life and death, and nondual awareness.
Further information and contact information
4. NDErs in the UK: how has your NDE impacted your wellbeing?
Objectives:
This project seeks NDEr participants in the UK to understand how they make sense of their NDE and how this impacts their wellbeing—more specifically, NDErs who would not consider themselves to be traditionally religious. This could be those who would say they are not formally religious but still believe that there is something ‘out there’ or beyond the physical world.
Researcher:
Dr. Alex Fry, Lecturer and wellbeing researcher at Bournemouth University.
Type of study:
You will be asked to take part in a one-to-one informal interview with Alex that will last between 75-90 minutes. It will feel more like a conversation.
Further information and contact information
5. Physicians who have had a near-death experience
Objectives:
We are recruiting
physicians
who have had a near-death experience (NDE) for an online study. The purpose of the study is to learn about physicians’ attitudes towards NDEs. Because of the impact of NDEs on experiencers’ lives, patients sometimes talk about these experiences with their physicians. This research aims to improve these interactions. We are interested in your participation even if you have not had patients who have reported an NDE.
Researchers:
Marieta Pehlivanova, Ph.D., and Bruce Greyson, M.D., of the Department of Psychiatry and  Neurobehavioral Sciences at the University of Virginia School of Medicine.
Type of study:
Participation in the study will take about 15 minutes of your time and will consist of an anonymous online questionnaire.
You are eligible to participate
if you are a physician in any specialty and have had a near-death experience.

Drs. van Lommel and Greyson: To the Rescue!
Once again, researchers have published an article
about bursts of brain activity in the dying human brain, and people interested in the question of the origin of NDEs have contacted
Journal of Near-Death Studies
editor, Jan Holden, EdD, asking whether the results described in the article provide a materialist explanation of the source of NDEs.
A challenge for intelligent lay readers is that most of us do not have the expertise to understand technical references to medical procedures and assessment results, such as "EEG gamma bursts," described in such articles. So, Jan reached out to two IANDS members who
do
have such expertise: cardiologist Pim van Lommel, MD, and emeritus professor of psychiatry and neurobehavioral sciences Bruce Greyson, MD.
In the brief (4.5 double-spaced pages) Invited Commentary linked below, these experts explain—in terms most readers should be able to understand—why the findings of this most recent study and others like it "do not and cannot explain" either confirmed aspects of NDEs or the source of NDEs. Their Invited Commentary will be published in an upcoming issue of the
Journal
but, as a service to IANDS members and to the general public, is
provided here
as a pre-print publication.

Spiritual Awakenings: Scientists and Academics Describe Their Experiences
Spiritual Awakenings: Scientists and Academics Describe Their Experiences
Edited by Marjorie Woollacott, PhD, and David Lorimer
The essays in this volume are a wonderful and varied collection of personal insights into individual spiritual awakenings and the resulting transformation in the lives of scientists and academics.
Scholars share the experience of their own spiritual awakening and journey, including encountering challenges to their credibility in academia, if they shared these experiences. Their comments about transformation in values, beliefs, and approaches toward life are very moving, expressing a deep inner wisdom and connection, not only with humanity but also with the earth and cosmos.
