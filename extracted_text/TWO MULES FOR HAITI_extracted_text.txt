About Us
Two Mules is a non-profit 501(c)(3), tax-exempt [EIN: 84-3250074] North Carolina corporation whose mission is to link rural Haitian communities with partner organizations and individuals to improve education, healthcare, agriculture and reforestation. We build opportunities for sustainable improvement by supporting projects that originate in, and are executed by, local community groups. We provide opportunities to support community organizers, teaching staff and healthcare professionals, and to supply medicines, seeds, animals and tools for agriculture. We assist in the formation of cooperative micro-financing programs for farming cooperatives, business start-ups and infrastructure projects such as water purification and sanitation, alternative fuel and solar energy. Our Board of Directors includes Haitians and Americans with professional expertise in law, community development, business, finance and healthcare, and our board members receive no income for serving.
