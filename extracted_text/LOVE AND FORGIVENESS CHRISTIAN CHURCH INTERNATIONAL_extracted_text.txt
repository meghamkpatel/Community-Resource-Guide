A Warning About the International Christian Church Group
TL;DR at the end, but I encourage everyone to read. In the future, you could be saving your own or someone’s time, money, health, and faith.
**The International Christian Church is a group that targets college students
,** especially ethnic minorities and international students (They also target financially unstable individuals and adults). **
They cherrypick excerpts from the Bible to prove their point.
They are not an official Christian group.**
**What they do:**
The ICC is an offshoot of the International Church of Christ, founded by Kip McKean in 2012, 9 years after getting kicked out of the ICOC (McKean founded and was leader of the ICOC) (Whatever is said of the ICC here, as far as I know, can also be said of the ICOC. Even though Mckean no longer is part of the ICOC, a lot of past practices have remained. The ICOC is slightly more benign - but also stay away). Members of the ICC (not all of them students) are on campus to badger students to partake in a “bible study” group. Students in the group also recruit during Zoom classes. The “bible study” group is a personalized meeting to recruit you and convince you that the only way to “God’s Kingdom” is through their group, and all others outside the ICC will be going to hell. **
Once you are baptized**
(a member of the group) [Past baptisms are illegitimate to them], **
they engage in manipulative behavior, restrict relationships (all types) to only within the group, verbally abuse members, and obligate you to donate money to the group.**
Being in the ICC also means that you are forced to dedicate an extreme amount of time to them. If you do not do so, you get threatened with going to hell. **
Students have dropped grades, classes, changed into easier majors, and even dropped out to continue taking part in the ICC.**
**Members of the group are not evil or have bad intentions.**
They also have been manipulated into buying into the group’s beliefs. They, too, have suffered everything that they will try to put you through. If you know someone in the ICC, **
do not**
attempt to pull them out without a substantial amount of research and consultation with cult experts and/or religious leaders. You will be playing their game. The ICC has trained its followers to believe that they are being persecuted by all others for their beliefs. (Hence the delicate language throughout the post). The ICC also calls critique of the group or any sort of warning about their behavior “spiritual pornography,” and prohibits members from reading it.
“The International Christian Churches are a controversial Christian movement. Some call us a cult and accuse us of both brain-washing and mind-control. Many false rumors and half-truths have been spread. Newspaper articles, television shows and especially the internet have slandered the ICC, and yet, the facts are that lives have been radically changed, marriages have been healed, drug addicts have been freed, the poor have been fed and cared for, and this rapidly growing movement – The SoldOut Movement – is spreading around the world in this generation! Just like the first century!” (First Principles 32)
**Here is the script that they use to recruit members during the bible study group:**
http://www.caicc.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FirstPrinciples_Eng.pdf
**Some of the lessons taught are:**
“Date and marry only disciples” (Dating means enforced double dates, and the most you are allowed to do by the ICC is hold hands. Sometimes, you do not get to choose who you date. If you want to propose, approval is required from the church leader and both of you must be completely “sold-out” to the ICC.)
“Everyone who wants to live as a disciple will be persecuted”
“Share the sins that you committed before being baptized and your feelings of being forgiven at baptism.” (Taken to an extreme in practice, and sin confession and criticism does not stop after baptism)

Here are all the places where the ICC has “churches”:
https://txt.fyi/-/2145/2e97c9af/
**There are over 100 universities that have baptized students.**
These are the universities that I have found to have members (Some universities have their acronyms instead of full names):
https://txt.fyi/-/20324/300caf40/
There is a doc at the end with the university names. It’ll be updated every once in a while.
If you attend any of these universities, I encourage you to warn your friends and peers about the ICC, and/or consult cult experts and religious leaders to help you alert your university’s administration and warn other students. The ICC is registered as a religious organization in some universities. You can also find posts warning about the ICC on college subreddits (See the docs at the end)
**The International Christian Church does not go by name on all campuses.**
They can go by “META Campus Ministry,” “DREAM Campus Ministry,” “Life On Campus,” “SF Campus Ministry,” “SOUL Campus Ministry,” “Life on ASU,” “L.I.F.E. at Syracuse University,” among many others.
**I implore you to share this with as many people as possible - you might end up saving a friend or peer.
The ICC has been rapidly expanding during a time when everyone feels alone.**
Although they are very welcoming at the beginning, by the end they will have taken your money and left you emotionally scarred.
For the sake of transparency and availability of information, attached is a google docs with every single resource I have found on the ICC:
**Everything Found On The International Christian Church:**

**Universities With International Christian Church Members or Official Student Orgs:**
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bkTuj_Ts8gmPANLKtHGDysn1900imuAvzxa4kttykJ8/edit?usp=sharing
TL;DR: The International Christian Church is a dangerous group. Targets college students (and adults) across the US and the world. Rapidly expanding. Emotionally and behaviorally manipulative, will take your money, and has left former members with health problems. **
Stay away.**
