Programming that is vital to Durham and the world. One of the most beautiful chapels to host an event in, with great acoustics. Love this place!
Michelle G.
‚ÄúThe building is filled with sooo much history. I've grown up going here for many events over the years. I was recently here for another wonderful event honoring 2 very talented local artists. There was music, food and fun. The art displays were great! I have no doubt that there will be many more visits here in the future!!‚Äù

It was one thing booking it but actually watching the performance was just amazing. The seats were comfortable and the staff was amazing üëè
