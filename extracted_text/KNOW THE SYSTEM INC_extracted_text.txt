Planting a Tree? Installing a Fence, Deck or Pool?
Whether you are doing the work yourself or hiring it out, you are responsible for assuring the utilities on your property are clearly marked and you avoid damaging them. MISS DIG 811 is Michigan’s ONLY resource for ensuring you know what’s below ground BEFORE you start to dig.
Here’s how it works:
Place a Locate Request
MISS DIG 811 processes that locate request by contacting our over 1,700 members, who then come out and locate their underground facilities.
Wait 3 Business Days
You cannot begin your excavation before the start time on your locate request, even if all utilities have been marked.
Confirm Status Online
You are required to check Positive Response before digging. Be sure to keep the ticket number provided to you when placing your locate request.
Hand Dig
Hand dig when digging within 4ft of paint or flags.
Dig Safely
Once you've hand exposed the underground utilities, you can carefully continue to dig using the necessary tools.

Reminder to Parents
The colorful flags used to mark underground utility lines can be very attractive to young children. Remind your children not to remove them. What happens if your child pulls out a utility flag marketing? Do not assume you remember where they were located and do not attempt to replace them.
Simply call MISS DIG 811 and to have the utility lines placed again.
