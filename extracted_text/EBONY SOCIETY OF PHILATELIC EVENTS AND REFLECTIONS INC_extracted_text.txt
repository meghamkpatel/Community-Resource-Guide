Ebony Society of Philatelic Events and Reflections
The Ebony Society of Philatelic Events and Reflections (ESPER) is an international stamp society dedicated to promoting the collecting of stamps and philatelic material depicting people and events related to the African diaspora and to encouraging and supporting the interest and participation of Black people in all aspects of philately. It is ESPER's sincere hope that visiting our website not only will enhance your knowledge of stamp collecting and Black heritage, but also will create a desire to start or revive your own collection of stamps or other philatelic material.
