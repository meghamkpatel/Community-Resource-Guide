WHAT WE DO
Leveraging technology to invite all people to know Jesus Christ
Every day, more than 5.16 billion people spend almost 7 hours on the Internet searching for answers, comfort, and distraction. Global Media Outreach meets people online in their time of need to share the eternal hope found in relationship with Jesus.
HOW WE DO IT
We accomplish this through a three-step process.
Through digital advertising and a powerful team of volunteer Online Missionaries, Global Media Outreach shares the Gospel in 13 languages—all day, every day.
Reach
| Online Ads
We present compelling ads through Google and social media, designed to relate to people’s questions and struggles.
Share
| Gospel Presentations
After engaging, people are taken to one of our Gospel pages or ministry sites where they can learn more about the Good News and accept Jesus Christ.
Grow
| Online Missionaries
Every person can then connect with an Online Missionary to grow in their faith through 1-on-1 discipleship or through free self-directed resources.
