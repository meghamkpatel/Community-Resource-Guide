We Believe in Transforming Lives through the Word of God.
We greet you in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ who has blessed us bountifully! Trinity Outreach Ministries International Inc. is a place where we extend our hearts and arms to love and embrace those of all ages, ethnicities, and nationalities. Our aim is to help others experience the abundant living God always intended them to have and to truly know the soul-saving grace of Jesus Christ. We seek wholeheartedly to meet the physical & spiritual needs of our community through the T3 Concept, which means "The Truth Transforms." We would like to thank everyone in advance for your support, be it your prayers, time, talent, treasure, and words of encouragement. We would ask that you follow us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube & the web for all our future outreach initiatives, programs, and services. We pray the Word of God you receive from this ministry uplifts and sustains you today and in the days to come. WELCOME TO TRINITY OUTREACH MINISTRIES INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED!
