The path to cures
How to help
Honor Mac Sinise's legacy
Moving Ahead for Cures (MAC)
Mac Sinise, the son of Gary and Moira Sinise and brother to Sophia and Ella, fought bravely against metastatic chordoma for more than five years before succumbing to the disease. Determined to bring to fruition his hope for cures, in 2024 the Sinise Family established the Moving Ahead for Cures (MAC) Fund in his memory. Donors to this fund are enabling us to bring new, more effective treatments to chordoma patients as quickly as possible.
We will forever be grateful for the generosity and commitment of the Sinise Family and everyone who stands with us in this quest. Because of you, those of us who continue to face chordoma have reason for hope.
