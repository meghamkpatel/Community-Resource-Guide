All About Community!
Welcome!
Dear Friend,
Thank you for visiting our website!  It is our desire to be a
friendly people, giving a positive Christian witness in the spirit of worship.
First Chronicles Community Church is a “work church” and we believe God
has called us to work while we can to help others in need. This is one of the
most exciting times in the life of our church and we are truly moving to
new
heights. There are some exciting outreach programs that are
currently
taking place directly affecting the lives of people in our community
right
now, not tomorrow or next week, but today.
We operate 24 hours a
day, 7
days a week, assisting in the
empowerment of the less fortunate.
Some of
the services we offer to the
community include: Transitional
Housing,
5 star
Daycare Services, Another
Way Youth Ministries, an
Employment
and
Training Center, and a variety
of
others programs. May
God’s
peace and
blessings be with you and your
family!
Welcome to First
Chronicles
Community Church – a church that is
“All About
Community!”
Blessings,
Pastor William V. Lucas, JD., M. Div.
Co-Pastor Pebbles Lucas, M. Ed., M. Div
