Assembly Website
Prayer is the first of the Church of God of Prophecy’s five core values. Prayer touches everything, informs all activities, empowers all ministry and service, and permeates the work from beginning to end.
We hold God’s Harvest call as a core value and a central mandate. It has not been rescinded or completely fulfilled. Neither can it be until all have heard.
We have allocated significant resources to create systems that cultivate a culture of excellence and produce competent, skilled leaders.
Jesus served. He calls his followers to serve. All across the world, Church of God of Prophecy leaders, churches, and members serve their communities in a myriad of ways.
The Church affirms that everything belongs to God and we are responsible to manage his holdings well and according to his desires and purposes.
