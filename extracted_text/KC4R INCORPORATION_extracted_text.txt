Very happy that the Berkeley Homes development at Leighwood Fields, Cranleigh was announced today as a Bronze Winner in the
Considerate Constructors Scheme
National Site Awards 2024

Our last two assessments have resulted in consecutive 45/45 scores & we are looking forward to keeping up the momentum in the coming years.

Well done to all of the other
Berkeley Group Plc
projects who collected awards. Great to see so many achieving at all levels.

Contractor Supervisor of the Month for April 2024 for Berkeley Homes Leighwood Fields goes to David Wallace of
APH Decorators Ltd
The team from APH are always guaranteed to be reliable & produce great quality work in a safe & professional manner. 

This month David oversaw a larger team than usual as we decided to pull ahead our programme & go for early year-end handovers. Still the same great quality, always well organised & never dropping from the high safety standards we expect every day.

The sun made an appearance earlier this week so it was a perfect opportunity to get some great photos of the latest affordable homes completed by Berkeley Homes at Leighwood Fields in Cranleigh. 

It has been a pleasure working with my colleague
Stephen Whittington
of Berkeley Partnerships &
Richard Gayton
and the team at
Metropolitan Thames Valley
through the construction phase to handover & completion. A great job well done by the Leighwoods Fields Project Team & all of our sub-contractors

The Berkeley Homes Leighwood Fields Project Team were quick in deciding the Contractor Supervisor of the Month with a unanimous vote. 

The February 2024 award goes to Chris Slade of
Goring Electrical Services Limited
Chris manages the electrical installations to be delivered on-time, to a high standard with top notch QA records. Also one of the most proactive & all round nice guys on site!

Each month at the Berkeley Homes Leighwood Fields project the team carefully choose the Contractor Supervisor of the Month.

For December 2023, the award goes to Ian Messenger of Briar Mechanical Services Southern Ltd

Ian & his team are consistently good performers, proactive & supportive. A great team to have on board for at Cranleigh.
