Areas of Impact
Child protection and welfare
Many of the issues faced in society can be traced back to fatherlessness or considerable instability inside the home. The Frazier Family Foundation has made this problem a central focus for outreach. Therefore, we have chosen to partner with entities whose aim is prevention, rescue, and restoration for children and teens in these unfortunate situations.
