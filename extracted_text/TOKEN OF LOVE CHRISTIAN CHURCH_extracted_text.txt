General Discussion
So I wanted to ask some questions to anyone who loves Sleep Token and also Jesus lol. My faith is important to me and I’ve been contemplating Sleep Token’s music and it’s effect on me and how that relates to my beliefs. Like so many others, from what I’ve seen in this sub, I obsessed over the music after I first heard it. I didn’t listen to any other bands for six months and felt like the music touched me in a way few other bands have. The music feels very spiritual to me and I’ve been inspired to worship God through it. I even felt that some lyrics, such as in songs like Rain, could be interpreted as being about God (not explicitly, the beauty of Sleep Token’s lyrics is they are open to interpretation from the listener). At first, I thought the whole relationship with Sleep thing was a fun gimmick, and I listen to plenty of secular music with non-Christian themes so I didn’t think much of it. But then I saw how integral the whole worship and offering thing is to the band and the community and wondered if the spiritual aspect is something I should distance myself from as a Christian. So I’m curious what other Christians think and how you feel the music relates to your faith. Does the music have a spiritual effect on you?
I’m not trying to start a religious debate and hold no judgment for others’ beliefs, I’m just trying to figure out how the music relates to my own, so I wanted to ask others about their experience.
