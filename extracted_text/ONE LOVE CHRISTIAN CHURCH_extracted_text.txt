At OLCC we recognize that as Believers we have certain inalienable rights.
We've listed 12 of your rights as a believer below.
RIGHT TO BE SAVED
And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. (Acts 2:21) (KJV)
RIGHT TO EMBRACE GOD’S GRACE
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. (Ephesians 2:8-9) (KJV)
RIGHT TO HAVE MY NEEDS MET BY GOD
But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. (Philippians 4:19) (KJV)
RIGHT TO GOD’S PEACE
And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. (Philippians 4:7) (NIV)
RIGHT TO DECREE MY HEALING
Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. (1 Peter 2:24) (KJV)
RIGHT TO HAVE MY PRAYERS ANSWERED
This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. (1 John 5:14) (NIV)
RIGHT TO LIVE WITHOUT FEAR
For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. (2 Timothy 1:7) (KJV)
RIGHT TO GOD’S PROTECTION
“no weapon forged against you will prevail, and you will refute every tongue that accuses you. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and this is their vindication from me, "declares the Lord". (Isaiah 54:17) (NIV)
RIGHT TO BE A CHILD OF GOD
Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. (1 John 3:2) (KJV)
RIGHT TO BE FORGIVEN
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.
(1 John 1:9)(NIV)
RIGHT TO BE CALLED THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD
God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
(2 Corinthians 5:21) (NIV)
RIGHT TO ETERNAL LIFE
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. (John 3:16)
Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; 26 and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?”
(John 11:25-26)
