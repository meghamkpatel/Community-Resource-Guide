WHO WE ARE
HOW CAN YOU HELP
WHO WE ARE
We empower and inspire youth to reach their fullest potential by providing opportunities for personal growth, leadership development, and community engagement. Since our founding in 1997, we have been committed to nurturing the physical, mental, and emotional well-being of young individuals, believing that every child deserves a chance to thrive.
WHAT WE DO
HOW CAN YOU HELP
WHO WE ARE
With the help of families, friends and local business, we organize youth basketball events in Clifton Park, NY. These events help us bring youth basketball events to the most underprivileged children in Niger. We identify youth basketball programs in Niger that shares our passion and work with them. We helped Nigerien children to attend basketball camps
and college in the US.
