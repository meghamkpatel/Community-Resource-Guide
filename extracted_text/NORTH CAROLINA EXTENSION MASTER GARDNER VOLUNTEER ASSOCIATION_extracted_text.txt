About
Extension Master Gardener℠
 Volunteers
Working with their local N.C. Cooperative Extension county center, Master Gardener℠ volunteers provide unbiased, research-based information that empowers residents to cultivate healthy gardens, landscapes, and ecosystems through safe, effective and sustainable gardening practices.
Since 1979, Extension has recruited, trained and engaged local residents to serve as Master Gardener volunteers who expand Extension’s capacity to meet the needs of the gardening public.
Under the guidance and direction of Extension agents, individuals complete a 40-hour training program, pass an examination, and complete at least a 40-hour internship to become certified Master Gardener volunteers. To remain active in the program, volunteers must complete a minimum of 20 hours of volunteer service and a minimum of 10 hours of continuing education each year.
About the NC State Extension Master Gardener Program
NC State University
and
N.C. A&T State University
work in tandem, along with federal, state and local governments, to form a strategic partnership called N.C. Cooperative Extension, which staffs local offices in all 100 counties and with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.
